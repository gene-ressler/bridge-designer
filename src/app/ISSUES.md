## Issues

- Help should be its own window.
  - Use router to select either help or BD.
- Scenario numbers in Project IDs are inconsistent:
  - Project ID of sample is loading with scenario number in text.
  - Scenario number missing in print views.
- Central texture manager. Should initiate loading all at startup.
- Defer loading of late/intermittent use code: help, print, fly-through.
- Limited hardware resilience? Need more info.

# Fixed issues

- Dirty edit save behavior missing for samples
- Material selector being reset way too often e.g. when changing modes.
- Edit joint should be selected automatically for new designs, file loads, and sample loads.
- Pause button is affecting water. Shouldn't.
- Watermarks on jqWidgets need removal.
- Need "loading..." display during app setup.
