      <p>
        Your bridge cannot be load tested because it's unstable. To make it stable, you should change your truss so
        that it's composed entirely of interconnected triangles. Often this means adding more members.

            (1) This truss is unstable, because the <span class="highlighted">highlighted</span> panel is rectangular,
            rather than triangular.
          </div>
          <div>
            (2) The rectangular panel is not rigid, so it cannot carry any load. There is nothing to prevent the entire
            truss from rotating about its supports, as shown here. It is unstable.
          </div>
          <div>
            (3) To fix the problem, add a diagonal member to divide the rectangular panel into triangles. Now the truss
            is rigid and can carry load. It is stable.

            along a straight line...
          </div>
          <div>
            (2) There is nothing to prevent the center joint from moving perpendicular to the two members, as shown
            here. The center joint can carry no load. It is unstable.

          <div>(3) To fix the problem, add a third member to the unstable joint, or...</div>
          <div>(4) Delete the unstable joint and the two attached members...</div>

            (5) Then replace them with a single member. Now the truss is rigid and can carry load. It is stable.

            supports. It is unstable.

            (3) To fix the problem, add a horizontal member connecting the two halves of the truss together. Now the

            (1) This truss is also unstable, because the center panel is four-sided. This example shows that any
            four-sided panel--not just a rectangular one--can make a truss unstable.
          </div>
          <div>
            (2) The four-sided panel is not rigid, so it cannot carry any load. There is nothing to prevent the entire

          </div>
          <div>
            (3) To fix the problem, add a vertical member to divide the four-sided panel into two triangles. Now the
            truss is rigid and can carry load. It is stable.

        If you're having trouble creating a stable truss, try using a template. On the main menu, click
        &quot;File&quot;, then &quot;Load template&quot;. The template will show you where to place joints and members
        to ensure that your truss is stable.
