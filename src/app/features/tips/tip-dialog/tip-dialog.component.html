          Normally, <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer, Cloud Edition</span> remembers your session's progress as
          long as you're using the same computer: design iterations, undo/redo items, and more. But see the next tip!

        <span
          >If you're using <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> with a shared computer and login, you might want
          to select <b>Edit</b> in the main menu and turn off <b>Remember my work</b> before closing your design
          session. This prevents others from seeing your design after you depart.</span
