  <h1>Assembling your bridge model</h1>
  <div class="p">
    These instructions assume you've already printed the parts of your model after using the instructions for
    <topic-link name="hlp_export_to_3dprint">>exporting OBJ files</topic-link>.
  </div>
  <h2>Prepare to build</h2>
  <div class="p">Some things you'll need to assemble the printed parts:</div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A flat, clean work surface protected from glue spills with paper: shelf paper or a large paper bag flattened out
      will work.
    </li>
    <li>Cyanoacrylate glue ("crazy glue"), or another plastic glue to bond the parts.</li>
    <li>Xacto knife, "box cutter," or single edge razor blade to trim parts as needed.</li>
    <li>Some fine sand paper, 150 to 220 grit, or a nail file or both.</li>
    <li>
      A tool to expand holes to a diameter equal to the minimum feature size (or slightly larger) if they're too small
      to fit corresponding pins. A tapered Xacto blade can work. A micro drill bit with a pin vice or other tool to spin
      the bit is ideal. Be careful!
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="p">
    Begin by laying out parts by type. A good way to avoid confusion is to draw a grid of nine boxes about three inches
    square on your build surface covering paper. Label them 1 to 9 and sort the parts as below.

  <h2>Important notes</h2>
  <div class="p">
    You can tell the difference between deck end and mid panels by looking for the tabs and slots where they fit
    together. The mid panel has both. The end panels have only tabs.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Your abutments will look a bit different from the picture above if one or both have an associated anchorage. In that
    case, there is an extra step and tab for a support cross-member pillow, used to connect the anchored members.
  </div>
  <h2>Build!</h2>
  <div class="p">
    Here are steps to complete your model. At each step, use your trimming tool and/or hole drill to make the joint fit
    well, with no gaps or excessive tightness, before applying glue. This may take some time. Be patient.
  </div>
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>
      Glue two support cross-members (1) into the slots of the two deck end panels (2). Set them aside in grid square
      (2) to dry.
    </li>
    <li>
      If your bridge has a pier at deck height, glue another support cross-member (1) into any deck mid-panel (3),
      otherwise go to the next step. Set this aside in grid square (3) to dry.
    </li>
    <li>Glue a pin cross-member (4) into the deck join beam (5).</li>
    <li>
      Glue all the remaining pin cross-members (4) into the remaining deck mid-panels (3). The numbers should match!
    </li>
    <li>Glue the deck join beam (5) onto one of the deck end panels (2). Return the assembly to square (5) to dry.</li>
    <li>Take a break! Wait until all glue applied so far is solid.</li>
    <li>
      "Dry fit" the whole deck by arranging deck panels (2, 3, 4, 5) top side up as shown in this diagram with
      <span class="i">no glue</span>. The end panels go on the end. The deck-level pier panel - if you have one - must
      also be in the right position. Use your tools to ensure that the panels fit together completely. Test each pair of
      panels to make sure the joint pins are no farther apart than the deck joints of the truss. If they are, you won't
      be able to attach them. Remove material from the panel tabs with sandpaper or file. Keep the panels in the dry fit
      left-to-right order to avoid confusion when assembling the deck!
    </li>
    <li>
      Tune all cross-member pins and truss holes as needed so each pin fits in each hole up to the shoulder as shown.
      Tuning means using your cutter, sandpaper or nail file, and hole drill or needle as needed to make the pin and
      hole sizes match.
    </li>
    <li>
      Identify the <span class="i">insides</span> of the trusses. These are <span class="i">smooth and flat</span>. When
      assembled, the inside surfaces point toward the deck. The opposite sides have a thickened gusset at each joint.
      These are the <span class="i">>outside</span> of the truss and point away from the deck.
    </li>
    <li>
      Attach the two leftmost deck joints of both trusses (7) to the the four pins of the deck join beam assembly (5).
      Make sure the inside of each truss points toward the deck.
    </li>
    <li>Take a break! Wait until deck join beam connections to the trusses are solid.</li>
    <li>
      Add the deck panels one at a time working from just right of the deck join beam assembly, gluing as you go. Be
      sure to keep the panels in the correct order as you dry fitted them!
    </li>
    <li>Take a break. Let all the deck panels dry completely.</li>
    <li>
      Add the rest of the pin cross-members (4) to all the truss joints. Make sure to skip support joints at abutments,
      pier, and anchorages! We'll get to those later.
    </li>
    <li>
      Glue the support cross member (1) pillows (triangular sections) to each abutment (8). The tab fits in the slot. If
      your bridge has anchorages, there's a second tab for a second support cross member. Glue a pillow to each of
      these, too. Finally if your bridge has a pier, glue the last pillow to its tab.
    </li>
    <li>
      Attach the truss to the abutments. Just fit the abutment pins through the corresponding truss pin holes. This
      includes the anchorage pins, if your bridge has them. No glue yet! Make sure the abutments are sitting on a flat
      surface, then add a drop of glue at each joint.
    </li>
    <li>Take a break! Make sure the bride attachment to its abutments is solid.</li>
    <li>
      Attache and glue the pier's pins to the truss, if you have one. Make sure the abutments and pier are sitting on a
      flat surface while the glue sets.
    </li>
    <li>You're done!</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="btop">Notes and tips</h2>
  <div class="p">
    Consider printing both a blueprint of your bridge and these assembly instructions on paper. Having the truss
    configuration as a ready reference and the steps for ticking off as you go is strangely satisfying!
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The bridge parts, particularly for big spans with anchorages, can be tiny. If you're feeling crafty, you can try
    printing the truss in two pieces to obtain a bridge of twice the scale that one print would allow. You will need to
    cut the truss in half with your slicer or other software, print each half separately, and glue them together as the
    first step of assembly.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Assembling a bridge model can be challenging! Be methodical. Work steadily. If something goes wrong, just reprint
    the parts you need, and try again. Good luck with this project!

    We do our best to make <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> work with most computing devices having a mouse
    or similar gadget plus a broad range of up-to-date browser software.
  </div>
  <h2>What should work</h2>
  <div class="p">
    <span class="b">Not phones.</span> Sorry. We don't support pure touch devices like most smart phones and pads with
    no mouse.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    <span class="b">Browsers.</span> Up-to-date versions of these should be fine:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Based on recent Chromium:
        <ul>
          <li>Google Chrome</li>

    Other Chromium- and Firefox-based browsers may work fine. Unfortunately, we can't support Apple Safari.

  <div class="p"><span class="b">Screen resolution.</span> At least 1200 by 800 pixels. More is better.</div>
  <div class="p">
    <span class="b">Mouse.</span> An accurate mouse-like pointing device. For example, a track pad or track ball should
    be fine.
  </div>
  <h2>How to fix problems</h2>
  <div>
    <span class="b">Switch browsers or upgrade.</span> If a startup warning complained about an unsupported browser or
    missing HTML or CSS features, try installing the current version of one of the supported browsers. If your device is
    unable, try the latest possible version of Google Chrome. That's the best chance of success.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    <span class="b">Adjust settings or hardware as needed.</span> If a startup warning included screen resolution or
    mouse, you'll need to adjust or replace hardware. Pro tips:
    <ul>
      <li>Screen resolution is usually a choice. Check your operating system's display settings.</li>
      <li>
        For screen resolutions around the minimum, set the browser to full screen mode to use all possible pixels.
      </li>
      <li>Many devices support adding a mouse, often for just a few dollars. Check the web.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    <span class="b">Take your chances.</span> Bridge Designer might be okay with the current browser despite the
    warnings, though some features are likely to be disabled or work poorly. You'll be notified about disabled features.
    Give it a try by clicking Cancel in the warning dialog.

  <div class="p">
    <img

      alt="AASHTO H25 Truck Loading"
    />
    The <topic-popup name="glos_aashto">AASHTO</topic-popup> H25 loading is a hypothetical cargo truck, similar to the
    one pictured here. The truck has two axles spaced approximately 4 meters apart. The truck has a total weight of 225
    kilonewtons (kN), with 44 <topic-popup name="glos_kn">kN</topic-popup> applied at the front axle and 181 kN at the
    rear.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    When the AASHTO truck loading is used to design a bridge, the axle weights are generally increased by a factor
    called the <topic-popup name="glos_dynamic_load_allowance">dynamic load allowance</topic-popup>, which accounts for
    the effects of the moving load.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    When a structural engineer designs an actual bridge, he or she must ensure that <span class="i">all</span>
    <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> in the structure can safely carry the
    <topic-popup name="glos_forces">forces</topic-popup> generated when one AASHTO truck loading is applied to
    <span class="i">every traffic lane</span> on the bridge <topic-popup name="glos_deck">deck</topic-popup>. The truck
    loading can be positioned anywhere along the length of the bridge.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    As indicated in the <topic-link name="hlp_design_specifications">design specifications</topic-link>, the
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> allows you to design a bridge for either of two highway loading
    conditions:
  </div>
  <ol>
    <li>Two lanes of highway traffic, represented by one H25 truck in each lane.</li>
    <li>A single 480 kN &quot;permit loading,&quot; centered laterally on the roadway.</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="p">
    In the first load case, with two traffic lanes, each of the two main trusses must carry the weight of one lane. Thus
    the loading used in the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> consists of one H25 truck, with a total weight
    of 225 kN.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    In the second case, with a single truck centered on the roadway, each of the two main trusses must carry one-half of
    the total truck weight. Thus the permit loading used in the
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> consists of 240 kN, with 120 kN applied at each axle location.
  </div>

  <h1>Cost of the design</h1>
  <div class="p">
    The <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> automatically calculates the cost of your bridge design as you
    create it. This cost is continuously updated and displayed on the
    <topic-link name="hlp_toolbars">status toolbar</topic-link>.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The cost calculated by <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span><span class="i"> does not</span> accurately

    competing factors that influence the cost of a typical engineering project: a learning tool.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The total cost of your bridge design consists of two major components -
    <topic-popup name="glos_site_cost">site cost </topic-popup> and truss cost. The site cost, in turn, is the sum of
    three components:

    <li><topic-popup name="glos_deck">deck</topic-popup> cost</li>

  <div class="p">The truss cost also includes three components:</div>
  <ol>
    <li>material cost</li>
    <li>connection cost</li>
    <li>product cost</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="p">
    All of these cost components are described below. The specific numerical cost factors for each are listed in the
    <topic-link name="hlp_design_specifications">design specifications</topic-link>.
  </div>
  <h2>Site Cost</h2>
  <div class="p">
    The <span class="i">site cost</span> consists of all costs associated with your selection of the
    <topic-link name="hlp_select_project">site configuration</topic-link> - the deck height,
    <topic-popup name="glos_span">span</topic-popup> length, and support configuration of your bridge.
  </div>
  <div class="p"><span class="i">Excavation Cost</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    When you select the deck height, you determine the amount of soil that must be excavated to achieve the correct
    highway elevation. The lower the deck, the more excavation is required. As in real-world construction, excavation is
    priced by the cubic yard or cubic meter. The
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> determines the required volume of soil excavation based on the selected
    deck elevation.
  </div>
  <div class="p"><span class="i">Deck Cost</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Your selection of the deck height also determines the overall span length of the bridge. A higher deck results in a
    longer span, which increases both the truss cost and the cost of the reinforced
    <topic-popup name="glos_concrete">concrete</topic-popup> deck.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    In the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span>, you can also select the material that the deck is made of -
    either medium-strength or high-strength concrete. Medium-strength concrete costs less than high-strength concrete,
    but its lower strength requires the deck to be thicker. This thicker deck weighs more than a thinner high-strength
    concrete deck and thus will increase the loading on the truss. Increased loading will cause the truss cost to
    increase. The result: a cheaper deck tends to require a more expensive truss and vice versa.
  </div>
  <div class="p">In either case, the cost of the deck is specified as a lump-sum cost for each 4-meter deck panel.</div>
  <div class="p"><span class="i">Support Cost</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    When you select the type of <topic-popup name="glos_abutment">abutments</topic-popup>,
    <topic-popup name="glos_pier">piers</topic-popup>, and cable
    <topic-popup name="glos_anchorages">anchorages</topic-popup> used in your bridge, the
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> determines the costs associated with constructing these supports. Each
    support configuration has its own unique cost. For a given type of
    <topic-popup name="glos_abutment">abutment</topic-popup> (standard or arch), the cost tends to increase with span
    length, because longer spans weigh more than shorter spans and thus transmit greater
    <topic-popup name="glos_loads">loads</topic-popup> to the supports. In general,
    <topic-popup name="glos_standard_abutments">standard abutments</topic-popup> cost less than
    <topic-popup name="glos_arch_abutments">arch abutments</topic-popup> for a given span length. The costs of arch
    abutments and piers also vary significantly with height. Higher abutments and piers use more material than shorter
    ones, so they cost more. Cable anchorages have a single lump-sum cost.
  </div>
  <h2>Truss Cost</h2>
  <div class="p">
    The <span class="i">truss cost</span> consists of all costs associated with the structural steel
    <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> and
    <topic-popup name="glos_connections">connections</topic-popup> that make up the two main trusses - the principal
    load-carrying elements of the bridge.
  </div>
  <div class="p"><span class="i">Material cost</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Structural steel is normally priced by weight (or mass); e.g., dollars per pound or dollars per kilogram. Thus the
    cost of a structure depends, in part, on the total weight of material used to build it. The
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> calculates the material cost by
  </div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      determining the total mass of the three available <topic-link name="hlp_materials">materials</topic-link> - carbon
      steel, high-strength steel, and quenched and tempered steel--in your
      <topic-popup name="glos_structural_model">structural model</topic-popup>
    </li>
    <li>multiplying the mass of each material type by the corresponding unit cost, in dollars per kilogram</li>
    <li>adding these together to get the total material cost.</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="p">
    As noted in the <topic-link name="hlp_design_specifications">design specifications</topic-link>, each of the three
    different types of steel has a different unit cost. Carbon steel is least expensive; quenched and tempered steel is
    most expensive. For a given material, hollow tubes are more expensive (per kilogram) than solid bars.
  </div>
  <div class="p"><span class="i">Connection cost</span></div>

    In real structures, the cost of fabricating and building the connections that join the members together can be very
    significant. Thus the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> includes a cost per joint as part of the total
    cost of the structure. Because the actual three-dimensional bridge has two main trusses, the number of connections
    used as the basis for this calculation is double the number of
    <topic-popup name="glos_joints">joints</topic-popup> in your two-dimensional structural model.
  </div>
  <div class="p"><span class="i">Product cost</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    In structural design and construction, the most economical design is often <span class="i">not</span> the one that
    simply minimizes the material cost. Often the total cost of the structure can be reduced by standardizing materials
    and member sizes. If all the members in a structure are different materials and sizes, then the cost of ordering,
    fabricating, and constructing those members will be relatively high. If many members are the same, fabrication and
    construction costs will be relatively lower. For this reason, the
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> includes a cost per product as part of the total cost of the truss. A
    <span class="i">product</span> is defined as any unique combination of material, cross-section, and
    <topic-popup name="glos_member_size">member size</topic-popup> in your structural model.
  </div>
  <h2>Cost Calculations</h2>
  <div class="p">
    To see the <span class="i">cost factors</span> (cost per kilogram, cost per joint, cost per product, and site cost)
    and the actual cost calculations for your current design, click the
    <topic-popup name="hlp_report_cost">report cost calculations button</topic-popup>. The
    <topic-link name="hlp_setup_wizard">site design wizard</topic-link> also displays detailed calculations for each
    component of the site cost.
  </div>
  <h2>Minimizing Total Cost</h2>
  <div class="p">
    As you attempt to minimize the total cost of your bridge design, you will find that you can
    <span class="i">never</span> minimize the site cost, material cost, connection cost, and product cost
    simultaneously. Minimizing the total cost is always a compromise among these four competing factors.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    To minimize the <span class="i">site cost</span>, you would simply select the site configuration that costs the
    least. But the least expensive site configuration requires a simply supported truss spanning a full 44 meters. This
    configuration will require a relatively heavy truss - one with a high
    <span class="i">material cost.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    To minimize the <span class="i">material cost,</span> you must make each member as light as it can possibly be
    without failing. For most truss configurations, achieving this condition requires the use of
    <span class="i">both</span> solid bars and hollow tubes in a wide variety of different sizes. Minimizing the
    material cost requires you to use a lot of different products and, as a result, your
    <span class="i">product cost</span> will be quite high.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    To minimize the <span class="i">connection cost</span>, you must use the smallest possible number of joints. But if
    you minimize the number of joints, you will inevitably have a few <span class="i">very long</span> members in your
    structural model. If a long member is subjected to compressive loading, it will require a very large member size to
    keep it from failing. (As a member gets longer, its
    <topic-link name="hlp_compressive_strength">compressive strength</topic-link> decreases significantly.) Thus
    minimizing the connection cost usually results in a high <span class="i">material cost</span>.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    To minimize the <span class="i">product cost</span>, you would need to use a <span class="i">single</span> material,
    cross-section, and size for every member in your structural model. But your single member size would have to be
    large enough to ensure that the most heavily loaded member in the structure does not fail. As a result, many of the
    other members would be much stronger - and therefore much heavier - than they really need to be, and your
    <span class="i">material cost</span> would be extremely high.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Clearly there are tradeoffs among site cost, material cost, connection cost, and product cost. Minimizing one
    <span class="i">always</span> increases one or more of the others. Your task as the designer is to find the best
    compromise.

    your bridge suitable for display.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Smallest printable feature size.</span> Model bridge members printed to scale can be too thin to
      print. This minimum feature size, given in millimeters, will be used instead of the scale size in such cases. One
      millimeter is the minimum. Larger values sacrifice scale appearance slightly, but make printing and assembly
      easier.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Wiggle room.</span> Most 3d printers place a bit too much material around small features like the
      holes and pegs used to align model bridge parts. This value is used to adjust sizes for a good fit. Every printer
      is different, so some trial-and-error may be needed to find a good value. 0.20mm is a starting point. If parts fit
      too tightly, try a larger wiggle room value and vice versa.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Scale.</span> This establishes the model's overall size. Move the slider to try different values.
      The dialog will show resulting maximum object dimensions. Make sure the maximums fit within your printer's build
      volume.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Base file name.</span> This determines the start of each OBJ file name containing bridge parts.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="p">When ready, click OK. Three files will be sent to your browser's Downloads folder:</div>
  <ul>
    <li>BASE_FILE_NAME-trusses.obj</li>
    <li>BASE_FILE_NAME-abutments.obj</li>
    <li>BASE_FILE_NAME-cross-members.obj</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="p">
    BASE_FILE_NAME will be substituted with the name from the dialog. Each file contains a collection of pieces placed
    so they're likely to fit the print volume. However, this is not guaranteed. You may want to arrange print batches
    differently.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Use you're slicer software and printer as usual to import the OBJ files and print the parts. Each item in each file
    is a separate "object" in the OBJ file format. Your slicer software should let you position these individually and
    delete ones that don't fit in a single print if necessary. Sometimes a "splitting" command is required to see the
    separate objects. Prusa Slicer, for example, requires that you highlight the import and press this button:<br />
    <img
      alt="Prusa split objects button"
      src="img/help/prusa-split-obj.png"
    /><br />
    For a multi-colored bridge, e.g one color for trusses, another for cross-members, and a third for the deck, you can
    also organize objects per intended color.

  <h2 class="btop">Notes and tips</h2>
  <div class="p">
    See <topic-link name="hlp_3dprint_assembly">tips for assembling your bridge model</topic-link> for important details
    after you've printed all parts.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The biggest pieces in the model are usually the trusses. If your goal is to make the biggest possible model, try
    printing trusses one at a time, oriented diagonally on the printer bed.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    For minimum feature size, consider using a multiple of your printer's nozzle size that's at least one millimeter.
    For example, if the nozzle is 0.4mm, then try 1.2 or 1.6.

    At this point in the design process, you have optimized your design for one particular site configuration and load
    case: one particular combination of <topic-popup name="glos_deck">deck</topic-popup> height,
    <topic-popup name="glos_span">span</topic-popup> length, support configuration, deck material, and truck loading.
    But, you won't know if your design is truly optimal until you have considered other site configurations and load
    cases.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> allows for 98 possible site configurations, consisting of various
    combinations of deck elevation, support type, and support height. There are also four possible load cases consisting
    of various combinations of deck material and truck loading. The
    <topic-link name="hlp_cost">total cost</topic-link> of the bridge equals the
    <topic-popup name="glos_site_cost">site cost</topic-popup> plus the truss cost. Each site configuration supports the
    bridge in a different way. Thus, each has a different site cost. Each load case has a different effect on the steel
    truss. Thus, each is likely to result in a different truss cost.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Even though the site cost makes up a major portion of the bridge's total cost, picking the configuration with the
    lowest site cost will not necessarily result in the lowest total cost. Site configurations that have a low site cost
    tend to have relatively high truss costs and vice versa.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    A site configuration with a high deck elevation will generally have a relatively low site cost because it requires
    little or no excavation. Yet, a configuration with a high deck elevation also has a greater span length. Longer
    spans require larger, heavier trusses, which leads to higher truss costs.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Arch <topic-popup name="glos_abutment">abutments</topic-popup> cost more than
    <topic-popup name="glos_standard_abutments">standard abutments</topic-popup>. Tall
    <topic-popup name="glos_arch_abutments">arch abutments</topic-popup> cost more than short ones. Thus, site
    configurations that use arches tend to have higher site cost. But, the V-shape of the river valley allows arch
    abutments to reduce the span length for a given deck height. The taller the
    <topic-popup name="glos_abutment">abutment</topic-popup>, the shorter the span. Arch abutments also provide more
    lateral restraint than standard abutments. Both of these factors tend to lower the truss cost for arches.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Building a <topic-popup name="glos_pier">pier</topic-popup> in the middle of a river can be quite expensive. Thus,
    configurations with <topic-popup name="glos_pier">piers</topic-popup> have significantly higher site costs than
    those without. But. the pier also divides one long span into two short ones. Two short trusses are usually much less
    expensive than a single long one.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Cable <topic-popup name="glos_anchorages">anchorages</topic-popup> are also expensive, but they provide for
    additional support and thus can reduce the truss cost significantly. An example is the cable supports of a
    cable-stayed bridge.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The choice of deck material affects both the site cost and the
    <topic-popup name="glos_loads">loads</topic-popup> applied during the
    <topic-link name="hlp_run_load_test">load test</topic-link>. Medium-strength
    <topic-popup name="glos_concrete">concrete</topic-popup> is less expensive than high-strength concrete, but it
    results in a thicker deck, which is heavier. High-strength concrete is more expensive but results in a thinner deck,
    which is lighter. Thus the less expensive deck material tends to result in a higher truss cost, while the more
    expensive deck material results in a lower truss cost.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Your choice of truck loading has no effect on the site cost but will have a significant effect on the truss cost.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    From all the above, the lesson to be learned is that engineering design always involves
    <span class="i">tradeoffs</span>. The tradeoff between the cost of a structure and the cost of its supporting
    <topic-popup name="glos_substructure">substructure</topic-popup> is a critically important aspect of most real-world
    bridge designs.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    So, which site configuration and load case will result in the lowest total cost? The only way you can answer this
    question is by trial and error combined with careful logical reasoning.
  </div>
  <h2>To find the optimum substructure configuration:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Click the <topic-popup name="hlp_new_design">new design button</topic-popup>. When the
      <topic-link name="hlp_setup_wizard">project setup wizard</topic-link> is displayed, select one of the site
      configurations or load cases you haven't tried yet. It is best to change only one variable at a time, so you can
      draw valid conclusions about the effect of the change. For example, suppose your first design was a single span
      with standard abutments and a deck height of 24 meters. For your second design, you might try an arch, but leave
      the deck height at 24 meters. Then the cost difference between the two trials can be directly attributed to the
      different support type. If you change the support type <span class="i">and</span> the deck height simultaneously,
      you won't know how each of these factors affects the cost.
    </li>
    <li>
      Repeat the previous eight steps of the design process for the new site configuration or load case. Decide on a
      truss configuration, draw <topic-popup name="glos_joints">joints</topic-popup>, draw
      <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup>, then
      <topic-popup name="glos_load_test">load test</topic-popup> the design, strengthen any
      <topic-popup name="glos_unsafe">unsafe</topic-popup> members, optimize the
      <topic-popup name="glos_member_properties">member properties</topic-popup>, optimize the shape of the truss, and
      optimize the truss configuration.
    </li>
    <li>
      Now compare the results of the two trials. Draw a logical conclusion about the one variable you changed on the
      second trial. For a particular deck height, did standard abutments or arch abutments result in a lower cost? How
      large was the difference between the two? If it was very large, you might be able to draw a general conclusion
      about the two support types. If the two results were close, you'll probably need to do more trials.
    </li>
    <li>
      Try another site configuration or load case. Again, change only one characteristic. If your second trial was a
      4-meter high arch, you might use a 12 meter or 16 meter height for this next trial. Again, repeat the entire
      design process to optimize your truss for this new site configuration. Again, compare these results with the
      previous trials and use the comparison as the logical basis for new exploration.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <div class="p">
    As you conduct more trials, you will be able to eliminate uneconomical site configurations and load cases. When
    you've eliminated all but one, you have the optimum.

  </div>
  <div class="p">
    When you use the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span>, you will experience the engineering design process in
    a simplified form. You will <topic-link name="hlp_how_to">design a highway bridge</topic-link> in much the same way
    that practicing civil engineers design real highway bridges.
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You will be presented with a requirement to design a steel
      <topic-link name="hlp_truss_bridges">truss bridge</topic-link> to carry a two-lane highway across a river.
    </li>
    <li>
      You may choose from a wide variety of different site configurations for your bridge. Each will cause your bridge
      to carry <topic-popup name="glos_loads">loads</topic-popup> in a different way, and each has a different
      <topic-popup name="glos_site_cost">site cost</topic-popup>.
    </li>
    <li>You will develop a design for your bridge by drawing a picture of it on your computer screen.</li>
    <li>
      Once your first design attempt is complete, the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> will test your
      bridge, to see if it is strong enough to carry the specified highway loads. This test includes a full-color
      animation showing a truck crossing your bridge. If your design is strong enough, the truck will be able to cross
      it successfully; if not, the structure will collapse.
    </li>
    <li>
      If your bridge collapses, you can strengthen it by changing the properties of the structural components that make
      up the bridge, or by changing the configuration of the bridge itself.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once your bridge can successfully carry the highway loading without collapsing, you can continue to refine your
      design, with the objective of minimizing its cost while still ensuring that it is strong enough to carry the
      specified loads.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="p">
    The <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> gives you complete flexibility to create designs using any shape or
    configuration you want. Creating a design is quick, so you can experiment with many different alternative
    configurations as you work toward the best possible one. The process you'll use is quite similar to the one used by
    practicing civil engineers as they design real structures. Indeed, the
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> itself is quite similar to the computer-aided design (CAD) software
    used by practicing engineers, and it will help you in the same way that CAD software helps them: by taking care of
    the heavy-duty mathematical calculations, so you can concentrate on the creative part of the design process.

  <h1>Load combinations</h1>
  <div class="p">
    Structural engineers use <span class="b">load combinations</span> to account for the fact that structures often
    experience several different types of <topic-popup name="glos_loads">loads</topic-popup> at the same time. For
    example, a bridge must simultaneously carry its own weight plus the weight of traffic and pedestrians crossing it.
    But the bridge <span class="i">might</span> also need to carry loads caused by high winds, snow, ice, or even an
    earthquake. It is highly unlikely that all these extreme loads will occur at the same time. For this reason, most
    structural design codes specify several different load combinations. Each corresponds to a particular extreme event
    - a really heavy truck loading or a really strong earthquake, for example. For each load combination, the extreme
    loading is combined with the average of other loads that might be present at the same time.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The 1994 <topic-popup name="glos_aashto">AASHTO</topic-popup> Bridge Design Specification requires bridge engineers
    to check eleven different load combinations for each bridge they design. The
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> uses only one these. It is:

    The <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> allows you to use three different

  </div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Carbon steel.</span> This is the most common grade of structural steel, composed primarily of iron

    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">High-Strength Low-Alloy steel.</span> This increasingly popular structural steel is similar to
      carbon steel but significantly stronger. The higher strength is attained from small amounts of manganese,

    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Quenched and Tempered Low-Alloy Steel.</span> This very high-strength steel is similar to

    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="btop">Notes and tips</h2>
  <div class="p">
    Which material is the best choice for a given structural design? The answer depends largely on the relative
    importance of cost and strength (yield stress) in the design. Carbon steel is the least expensive of the three
    alternatives, but it also has the lowest strength. High-strength low-alloy steel is somewhat more expensive but
    about 40% stronger than carbon steel. Quenched and tempered low-alloy steel is both the strongest and most expensive
    of the three. All three materials have approximately the same

    One of the <topic-link name="hlp_purposes">purposes</topic-link> of the
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> is to provide a <span class="i">realistic</span>, hands-on experience
    that will help you to understand how civil engineers design real structures. Many aspects of the software accurately
    reflect the structural design process; however, a number of significant compromises have been made to keep the
    program from getting too complex. <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> is intended as an
    <span class="i">introduction</span> to engineering design, with emphasis on the
    <span class="i">design process</span>, rather than the detailed technical aspects of structural design.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The bottom line is that some aspects of the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> are realistic, and some are
    not. It is important that you understand the difference.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The following aspects of the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> <span class="i">do not</span> accurately
    reflect the process that practicing civil engineers use to design real bridges:
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In designing an actual bridge, engineers must develop detailed designs and cost estimates for the
      <topic-popup name="glos_abutment">abutments</topic-popup>, the <topic-popup name="glos_pier">piers</topic-popup>,
      the roadway, the <topic-popup name="glos_deck">deck</topic-popup>, and the complete three-dimensional structural
      system, including the main trusses, all <topic-popup name="glos_connections">connections</topic-popup>, the
      <topic-popup name="glos_concrete">concrete</topic-popup> deck, its supporting steel framing, and many secondary
      <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup>. Engineers would also need to consider the environmental
      impact of the bridge and the effects of water and ice in the river channel as an integral part of the design. In
      the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span>, you design only the main trusses and make some preliminary
      decisions about the configurations of the roadway and supports. The design is strictly two-dimensional and thus
      does not account for three-dimensional stability.
    </li>
    <li>
      In designing an actual bridge, engineers must consider the effects of <span class="i">fatigue</span> - the
      tendency of a structural material to fail prematurely as a result of the repetitive loading caused by vehicular
      traffic. The <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> does not consider fatigue.
    </li>
    <li>
      In designing an actual bridge, engineers must consider many different types of loading, to include several
      different forms of vehicular <topic-popup name="glos_loads">loads</topic-popup>, self-weight, wind, snow,
      collision by vehicles and ships, and earthquakes. They must consider both the longitudinal and lateral position of
      vehicular loads on the bridge deck. They must also consider numerous
      <topic-link name="hlp_load_combinations">load combinations</topic-link> - eleven in the 1994
      <topic-popup name="glos_aashto">AASHTO</topic-popup> Bridge Design Specification. The
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> considers only two types of vehicular loading and the self-weight of
      the bridge. It considers only the longitudinal position of the vehicular loading, not the lateral position.
    </li>
    <li>
      In designing an actual bridge, engineers must consider limitations on
      <span class="i">deflections</span> - the amount of bending that occurs when a vehicle crosses the bridge. The
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> calculates deflections and displays them during the
      <topic-popup name="glos_load_test">load test</topic-popup>, but does not use them as a design criterion.
    </li>
    <li>
      In designing an actual bridge, engineers must consider many additional member failure modes not considered by the
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> load test, the
      <topic-popup name="hlp_aashto_h20x44">AASHTO truck loading</topic-popup> represents two lanes of highway traffic,
      and this loading is moved across the bridge in one direction - from left to right. The AASHTO loading has a heavy
      rear axle and a lighter front axle. Because this loading is asymmetrical, an optimally bridge for the
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> might be asymmetrical as well. However, the design of real bridges
      must consider the movement of the AASHTO loading in <span class="i">both</span> directions: left to right
      <span class="i">and</span> right to left. As a result, optimally designed real-world bridges are generally
      symmetrical.
    </li>
    <li>
      Though the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> attempts to accurately demonstrate the cost tradeoffs
      inherent in engineering design, the actual costs of the structural materials and components used in the software
      are not intended to be accurate.
    </li>
    <li>
      In designing an actual bridge, engineers must consider <span class="i">esthetics</span>. The
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> does not include esthetics as a design criterion, though you can
      certainly set a personal goal to design only good-looking bridges!
    </li>
  </ul>

    At this point in the design process, you have optimized the
    <topic-popup name="glos_member_properties">member properties</topic-popup> for one specific truss configuration. But
    there are probably other configurations that will result in more economical designs. Design is inherently an
    iterative process. To achieve a truly optimal design, you will need to experiment with many different
    configurations, and carefully observe how changes in the truss geometry affect the cost of your design.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Before you try a totally new truss configuration, you should first optimize the
    <span class="i">shape</span> of your current
    <topic-popup name="glos_structural_model">structural model</topic-popup>. You can change the shape of the truss by
    <topic-link name="hlp_move_joint">moving one or more joints</topic-link> - by dragging them to a new location with
    your mouse or keyboard. This modification is very easy to do and can produce significant reductions in the cost of
    your design.
  </div>
  <h2>To optimize the shape of your current structural model:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Try changing the depth of your truss.

        <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> will require less material, their cost will decrease.
        However, reducing the depth of a truss also causes the
        <topic-popup name="glos_member_force">member force</topic-popup> in the top and bottom
        <topic-popup name="glos_chords">chords</topic-popup> to <span class="i">increase</span>. Thus you will probably
        need to increase the size (and cost) of the top and bottom chord members to ensure that the design still passes
        the <topic-popup name="glos_load_test">load test</topic-popup>.
      </div>
      <div class="p in3">
        If you increase the depth of the truss, the opposite effects will occur. The verticals and diagonals will get
        longer and, thus, they will increase in cost. But the member
        <topic-popup name="glos_forces">forces</topic-popup> in the top and bottom chords will decrease, allowing you to
        use smaller, less expensive members for the chords.
      </div>
      <div class="p in3">
        There is a trade-off between these two competing factors: (1) the member force in the top and bottom chords and
        (2) the length of the verticals and diagonals. Every truss has an optimum depth, which represents the best
        compromise between these two factors. The best way to find the optimum depth for your design is through trial
        and error.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      Try changing the overall shape of your truss.
      <div class="p in3">
        For example, suppose you started with the standard Pratt Through Truss for your current design:
      </div>
      <div class="p in4">
        <img
          alt="To optimize the shape of your current structural model:"

      </div>
      <div class="p in3">
        Try moving the top-chord <topic-popup name="glos_joints">joints</topic-popup> to create a more rounded shape:

        />
      </div>
      <div class="p in3">
        Often this minor adjustment can reduce the cost of a design significantly. When a truss has this rounded shape,
        the member forces tend to be nearly equal in every member in the top chord. Thus, if you get the shape just
        right, you can use a single optimum

    your design is <span class="i">successful</span>. However, your design is not <span class="i">optimal</span> until
    you minimize its cost. The first step in optimizing your design is to minimize the cost of your
    <span class="i">current truss configuration</span> by optimizing the
    <topic-popup name="glos_member_properties">member properties</topic-popup> -
    <topic-link name="hlp_materials">material,</topic-link>
    <topic-popup name="hlp_crossxsection">cross-section,</topic-popup> and
    <topic-popup name="glos_member_size">member size</topic-popup>. At this stage in the design process, you should not
    change the shape or configuration of your current structural model.
  </div>
  <h2>To optimize the member properties:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Ensure that you understand how the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> calculates the
      <topic-link name="hlp_cost">cost of your design</topic-link>. In particular, understand the trade-off between
      <span class="i">material cost</span> and <span class="i">product cost</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Minimize the <span class="i">material cost</span>. There are several approaches you might use to minimize material
      cost; the following procedure is recommended for inexperienced designers:
    </li>
    <li>Start by using the lowest cost (but weakest) available material - carbon steel - for all members.</li>
    <li>
      Select an appropriate <topic-popup name="hlp_crossxsection">cross-section</topic-popup> for each member. It is
      usually best to use solid bars for <topic-popup name="glos_tension">tension</topic-popup> members and hollow tubes
      for <topic-popup name="glos_compression">compression</topic-popup> members. For more information, see
      <topic-link name="hlp_bars_or_tubes">Solid Bar or Hollow Tube?</topic-link>
    </li>
    <li>
      Now use a systematic trial and error procedure to determine the smallest possible member size for every member in
      the structural model. Starting with a <span class="i">successful</span> design, decrease the size of every member
      to the next smaller available size. (See
      <topic-link name="hlp_change_member_properties">Change the Properties of a Member</topic-link> for more
      information.) Then run the <topic-popup name="glos_load_test">load test</topic-popup> again. If any member fails,
      its size is too small; change it back to its previous (larger) size. For each member that is
      <topic-popup name="glos_safe">safe</topic-popup>, decrease its size again, and run the load test. Keep reducing
      its size and running the load test until the member fails, then increase its size by one. If you use this process
      systematically for every member in the structural model, you will ensure that every member is as small (and
      inexpensive) as it can possibly be without failing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally, go back and check if using either of the other two materials--high-strength steel or quenched and
      tempered steel--will reduce the overall cost of the design. Both of these steels have significantly higher
      <topic-popup name="glos_yield_stress">yield stress</topic-popup> than carbon steel, so using them will allow you
      to reduce the size of members without reducing their strength. But both high-strength steel and quenched and
      tempered steel are more expensive (in dollars per kilogram) than carbon steel. You will need to use trial and
      error to determine if the benefit of increased strength is sufficient to offset greater cost of the high-strength
      steels. It is permissible to use two or three different materials in the same design.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once you have adjusted the materials, cross-sections, and member sizes to minimize the material cost of your
      design, be sure to run the load test once more to ensure that all members are safe.
    </li>
    <li>
      Optimize, based on <span class="i">product cost</span>. When you minimized the
      <span class="i">material cost</span> (above), you probably introduced a large number of different products into
      your design. Thus, even though your material cost is low, your <span class="i">product cost</span> is probably
      quite high, and your total cost is almost certainly not optimum. Use the following procedure to find the best
      balance between these two competing cost factors:
    </li>
    <li>
      Check the <topic-popup name="hlp_report_cost">Cost Calculations Report</topic-popup> to see how many products are
      currently included in your design. In particular, identify any products that are used for only a few members in
      your structural model.
    </li>
    <li>
      Change the properties of these particular members to match the next larger (or next stronger) available product in
      your current design. For example, suppose your design includes two 40 mm solid carbon steel bars and four 60 mm
      solid carbon steel bars. Change the two 40 mm bars to 60 mm bars. This modification will increase the material
      cost somewhat, but will reduce the number of products by one. This modification will probably
      <span class="i">not</span> reduce the safety of the structure, since you are making the two 40 mm members
      <span class="i">stronger</span>. If the reduction in product cost exceeds the increase in material cost, the
      change is a good one. If not, reject the change by clicking the
      <topic-popup name="hlp_undo">Undo button</topic-popup>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Continue this trial-and-error process of selectively increasing member sizes (or using stronger materials) to
      reduce the total number of products in the design. Generally, you will find that reducing the number of products
      creates substantial cost savings at first; however, as the degree of standardization increases, the cost savings
      get progressively less. Ultimately, too much standardization will cause the total cost of the design to rise. The
      design that minimizes total cost is the optimum.
    </li>
    <li>
      Before moving on to the next step in the design process, be sure to run the load test one more time,
      <span class="i">even if all of your modifications involved making members larger</span>. Increasing the size of a
      member makes that member both stronger and heavier. When member weights increase, the total weight of the truss
      increases. As a result of this increase in load, member <topic-popup name="glos_forces">forces</topic-popup> will
      also increase, and some members which were previously safe might become unsafe.

  <div class="p">
    One of the <topic-link name="hlp_purposes">purposes</topic-link> of the
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> is to provide a <span class="i">realistic</span>, hands-on experience
    that will help you to understand how civil engineers design real structures. Many aspects of the software accurately
    reflect the structural design process; however, a number of significant compromises have been made to keep the
    program simple. <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> is intended as an
    <span class="i">introduction</span> to engineering design, with emphasis on the
    <span class="i">design process</span>, rather than the detailed technical aspects of structural design.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The result is that some aspects of the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> are realistic, and others are
    not. It is important to understand this.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The following aspects of the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> reflect, with reasonable accuracy, the
    nature of engineering design and the process that practicing civil engineers use to design real bridges:
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Design is an open-ended process. Real-world design problems always have many possible solutions.
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> shows this by allowing you much freedom to choose and refine the
      configuration of your bridge.
    </li>
    <li>
      Though design is open-ended, the process is always constrained by real-world conditions and restrictions.
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> demonstrates this by limiting design in three ways:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <topic-popup name="glos_span">Span</topic-popup> lengths and support configurations must conform to conditions
          of the project site.
        </li>
        <li>Materials and member types must be chosen from a limited set.</li>
        <li>Minimizing cost is set as an important goal.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Design is inherently an iterative process. Because engineers usually work with incomplete information, they must
      often make assumptions, then check and revise those assumptions as design progresses. Developing a high-quality
      solution always requires the engineer to consider many alternatives and ultimately to select the best one.
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> clearly demonstrates this aspect of the design process. It is
      impossible to achieve a truly optimal bridge design without considering many different alternative truss
      configurations, materials, cross-sections, and member sizes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Design always involves trade-offs. It is usually not possible to find a single solution that best satisfies all
      design criteria. Making improvements in one area often causes problems somewhere else. You will experience many of
      these same trade-offs when you use
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span>. For example, as you attempt to optimize your design, you will
      discover that reducing the <span class="i">depth</span> of a truss causes the cost of the
      <topic-popup name="glos_verticals">verticals</topic-popup> and
      <topic-popup name="glos_diagonals">diagonals</topic-popup> to <span class="i">decrease</span> (because they get
      shorter); but it also causes the cost of the top and bottom
      <topic-popup name="glos_chords">chords</topic-popup> to <span class="i">increase</span> because their
      <topic-popup name="glos_member_force">member force</topic-popup> increases, and larger member sizes are needed to
      preserve structural <topic-popup name="glos_safe">safety</topic-popup>. You will need to find the optimum balance
      between the two competing criteria.
    </li>
    <li>
      Structural engineering design is regulated through the use of <span class="i">codes</span>. Codes ensure that
      engineering is practiced in a consistent, <topic-popup name="glos_safe">safe</topic-popup> manner throughout the
      country, region, or municipality. There are separate, industry-standard codes governing the design of steel,
      <topic-popup name="glos_concrete">concrete</topic-popup>, and wood structures. There are regional and local
      building codes that specify design <topic-popup name="glos_loads">loads</topic-popup>, fire protection standards,
      and many other requirements for designing buildings. Design of highway bridges in the US is governed by the
      <topic-popup name="glos_aashto">AASHTO</topic-popup> Bridge Design Specification. In
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span>, the <topic-popup name="glos_load_test">load test</topic-popup> uses
      a standard (but slightly modified) AASHTO truck loading, and the compressive and tensile strengths of
      <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> are computed exactly as specified in the AASHTO
      Specification.
    </li>
    <li>
      Structures are generally designed such that they can safely carry one or more code-specified loadings. Minimizing
      cost is also often an important objective--but <span class="i">never</span> as important as structural safety.
      Cost reductions can never be made if those reductions compromise structural safety. The formulation of
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> is based on this same relationship between safety and cost. In
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> your design objective is to minimize cost, but a design is
      <span class="i">never</span> valid if it fails the load test.
    </li>
    <li>
      Structural design is often characterized by trade-offs between material cost, fabrication cost, and construction
      cost. When a structure is designed to minimize material cost, the design will often include many different member
      types and sizes. But a variety of member sizes makes it harder (and therefore more expensive) to
      <topic-popup name="glos_cut">cut</topic-popup> and fit members (fabrication) and to assemble them on a job site
      (construction). Structural designers usually attempt to achieve a degree of
      <span class="i">standardization</span> in their selection of structural elements, even if that means
      over-designing some of them. The resulting increase in material cost is usually offset by savings in fabrication
      and construction costs. The <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> cost calculation simulates this trade-off
      reasonably well.
    </li>
    <li>
      In modern structural engineering practice,
      <topic-popup name="glos_structural_analysis">structural analysis</topic-popup> is generally performed using a
      computer-based method called <span class="i">matrix structural analysis</span>, more specifically called the
      <span class="i">Direct Stiffness Method</span>. <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> uses this method to
      compute member <topic-popup name="glos_forces">forces</topic-popup> during the load test.

  <div class="p">
    There are 98 possible site configurations as mentioned above. There are four possible load cases consisting of the
    two deck materials and two truck loadings. Overall this makes 392 possible choices. Each represents a different type
    of support or loading, and each has a different cost. All are consistent with the
    <topic-link name="hlp_design_specifications">design specifications</topic-link>.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The <topic-link name="hlp_cost">total cost</topic-link> of the bridge equals the site cost plus the truss cost. But
    picking the configuration with the lowest site cost is unlikely to result in the lowest total cost. In general,
    configurations with low site cost tend to require a relatively high cost truss and vice versa. Finding the best
    balance is what engineers do!
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    For example, a configuration with a high deck elevation will have a relatively low site cost because it requires
    little or no excavation. But, a high deck elevation also has a greater
    <topic-popup name="glos_span">span</topic-popup> length. This requires a larger, heavier truss, which has a
    high truss cost.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Arch abutments cost more than <topic-popup name="glos_standard_abutments">standard abutments</topic-popup>, and tall
    arch abutments cost more than short ones. Thus site configurations that use arches tend to have higher site cost.
    But because of the V-shape of the river valley, arch abutments also reduce the span length (for a given deck
    height). The taller the <topic-popup name="glos_abutment">abutment</topic-popup>, the shorter the span. Arch
    abutments also provide more lateral restraint than standard abutments. Both of these tend to decrease truss costs.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Building a pier in the middle of a river can be expensive. This means configurations with
    <topic-popup name="glos_pier">piers</topic-popup> have higher site costs than those without. But, the pier also
    divides one long span into two short ones. Two short trusses are usually much less expensive than a single long one.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Cable anchorages are also expensive, but they provide additional support (e.g., the cable supports of a cable-stayed
    bridge). This can reduce truss cost significantly.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The choice of deck material affects both the site cost and the loads applied during the
    <topic-link name="hlp_run_load_test">load test</topic-link>. Medium-strength concrete is less expensive than
    high-strength, but it results in a thicker deck, which is heavier. High-strength concrete is more expensive but
    results in a thinner deck, which is lighter. Thus the less expensive deck material tends to result in a higher truss
    cost, while the more expensive deck material results in a lower truss cost.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Your choice of truck loading has no effect on the site cost but will have a significant effect on the truss cost.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Engineering design always involves <span class="i">tradeoffs</span>. The tradeoff between the cost of a structure
    and the cost of its supporting <topic-popup name="glos_substructure">substructure</topic-popup> is a critically
    important aspect of most real-world bridge designs.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    So which site configuration and load case will result in the lowest total cost? For now, don't worry about it. Just
    take your best guess and move on to the <topic-link name="hlp_truss_configuration">next step</topic-link> in the

  <div class="p">
    In practice, engineering design is really just a specialized form of <span class="b">problem solving</span>.

  <ol>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Identify the problem.</span> A <topic-popup name="glos_client">client</topic-popup> hires a team
      of engineers to design a highway bridge that will cross a river.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Define the problem.</span> The engineers investigate the proposed site and work with the client to
      determine exactly what the functional requirements of the bridge will be. Where will the bridge be located? How
      many lanes of traffic are required? What are the characteristics of the river--width, depth, current velocity? Is
      the river used by ships? If so, how wide a navigable channel and how much overhead clearance do the vessels need?
      Who owns the land on either side of the river? What sort of soil and rock are located there? The engineers also
      determine if there are any aesthetic requirements for the structure and, perhaps most importantly, they find out
      how much money the client is willing to pay for the new bridge--the project budget.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Develop alternative solutions.</span> The engineers develop several alternative
      <span class="i">concept designs</span> for the new bridge--perhaps a truss, an arch, and a suspension bridge.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Analyze and compare alternative solutions.</span> The engineers analyze each design alternative to
      determine its strengths and weaknesses, with respect to the project requirements and constraints identified in
      Step 2 above. They also consider the environmental impact and constructability of each proposed option.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Select the best alternative.</span> After carefully analyzing all of the alternatives, the
      engineers select the one that best satisfies the project requirements. They present this selection as a
      recommendation to the client, who makes the final decision.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Implement the solution.</span> Once the client has approved the concept design, the team completes
      the final design, prepares plans and specifications, and hands them over to a construction contractor to build.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Evaluate the results.</span> At the end of the project, the engineers evaluate the completed
      structure. They identify aspects of the project that went well and aspects that could be improved. Ultimately

  <div class="p">
    A truss is an arrangement of structural <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> that are connected

  <h2>Truss Bridges</h2>
  <div class="p">
    Trusses have been used extensively in bridges since the early 19th Century. Early truss bridges were made of wood.
    The classic American covered bridges are all trusses, though the wooden truss members are covered by walls and a
    roof, for protection from the elements. Later truss bridges were made of cast iron and wrought iron. Most modern
    trusses are made of structural steel. Truss bridges can be found in many different

    Design is inherently an iterative process. To achieve a truly optimal design, you will probably need to try many
    different truss configurations. As you might guess, however, there are
    <span class="i">millions</span> of possible configurations, and you probably won't have time to try them all! How
    can you find the optimum, without modeling and testing every possible truss configuration? One approach is to
    consider alternative configurations in a very systematic way. Select a configuration, optimize its
    <topic-popup name="glos_member_properties">member properties</topic-popup>, and carefully observe how changes in the
    configuration affected the cost of your design. Keep track of which changes produce reductions in cost and which do

  <h2>To find the optimum truss configuration:</h2>

      Try a different <topic-popup name="glos_deck">deck</topic-popup> location. If your first design was a

      Try reducing the length of the <topic-popup name="glos_compression">compression</topic-popup>
      <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> in the truss. The

      length. As a member gets longer, its compressive strength decreases substantially--it has much less resistance to
      <topic-popup name="glos_buckling">buckling</topic-popup>. For this reason, the cost of a truss design can
      sometimes be reduced by shortening one or more compression members.
      <div class="p in2">For example, let's start with a standard Warren Through Truss:</div>
      <div class="p in3">
        <img
          src="img/help/warren.png"
          alt="To find the optimum truss configuration:"
        />
      </div>
      <div class="p in2">
        Because the top <topic-popup name="glos_chords">chords</topic-popup> of a simple-span truss bridge are always in
        compression, we might be able to reduce the cost of the Warren truss by subdividing its top chord members, like
        this:
      </div>
      <div class="p in3">
        <img
          src="img/help/warren_c.png"
          alt="To find the optimum truss configuration:"
        />
      </div>
      <div class="p in2">Now consider a standard Pratt Through Truss:</div>
      <div class="p in3">
        <img
          src="img/help/pratt.png"
          alt="To find the optimum truss configuration:"
        />
      </div>
      <div class="p in2">
        In this configuration, the top chords <span class="i">and</span> the
        <topic-popup name="glos_verticals">verticals</topic-popup> are normally in compression. Thus, we could subdivide
        <span class="i">both</span> the top chords and the verticals, like this:
      </div>
      <div class="p in3">
        <img
          src="img/help/pratt_c1.png"
          alt="To find the optimum truss configuration:"
        />
      </div>
      <div class="p in2">
        Note that, in both examples, the length of each compression member is reduced by half. This reduction in length
        will usually allow the designer to use a substantially smaller
        <topic-popup name="glos_member_size">member size</topic-popup> to achieve the required compressive strength.
      </div>
      <div class="p in2">
        Note also that, when you subdivide a member, you will always need to add additional
        <topic-popup name="glos_joints">joints</topic-popup> and members to maintain the
        <topic-link name="hlp_structural_stability">stability</topic-link> of the truss. To be stable, a truss generally
        must be made up of a series of interconnected triangles.
      </div>
      <div class="p in2">
        To subdivide a compression member in the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span>, you must:
      </div>
    </li>
    <li><topic-link name="hlp_delete_member">delete the compression member</topic-link> you want to subdivide,</li>
    <li>
      <topic-link name="hlp_draw_joint">add a new joint</topic-link> at or near the midpoint of the member you just
      deleted,
    </li>
    <li><topic-link name="hlp_draw_member">add two new members</topic-link> to replace the original member,</li>
    <li>add additional members to ensure <topic-link name="hlp_structural_stability">stability,</topic-link> and</li>
    <li>
      <topic-link name="hlp_optimize_member_selection">optimize the member properties</topic-link> of all new members.
      <div class="p in2">
        Reducing the length of compression members may or may not reduce the total cost of your design, depending on
        whether the cost saving from using smaller member sizes is enough to offset the increased cost of the additional
        joints and members.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      Try reducing the number of joints. The <topic-link name="hlp_cost">cost of your design</topic-link> includes a
      fixed cost per joint. Thus you may be able to reduce the total cost by reducing the number of joints in your
      <topic-popup name="glos_structural_model">structural model</topic-popup>.
      <div class="p in2">For example, consider the standard Howe Deck Truss:</div>
      <div class="p in3">
        <img
          src="img/help/dhowe.png"
          alt="To find the optimum truss configuration:"
        />
      </div>
      <div class="p in2">
        This configuration can be improved by simply removing the joint at the midpoint of the bottom chord, like this:
      </div>
      <div class="p in3">
        <img
          src="img/help/dhowe_b.png"
          alt="To find the optimum truss configuration:"
        />
      </div>
      <div class="p in2">
        When you <topic-link name="hlp_delete_joint">delete this joint,</topic-link> all three attached members will be
        deleted as well. You will need to add a single new member to replace the two bottom chord members you deleted.
      </div>
      <div class="p in2">
        This modification is often effective for <topic-popup name="glos_tension">tension</topic-popup> members (like
        the bottom chord members in the example above), because
        <topic-link name="hlp_tensile_strength">tensile strength</topic-link> is <span class="i">not</span> a function
        of length. However, removing a joint from the top chord of a truss, as shown below, is less likely to be
        effective.
      </div>
      <div class="p in3">
        <img
          src="img/help/pratt_t2.png"
          alt="To find the optimum truss configuration:"
        />
      </div>
      <div class="p in2">
        By deleting a top chord joint and replacing two chord members with one, you would double the length of a
        compression member, making it <span class="i">much</span> weaker. You would need to use a substantially larger
        member size to make this member strong enough to pass the
        <topic-popup name="glos_load_test">load test</topic-popup>. Thus any benefit from the reduced number of joints
        would probably be lost.

  <div class="p">
    The <topic-link name="hlp_drawing_board">Drawing Board</topic-link> is covered by a grid. (You can't see it, but

  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The Grid Resolution buttons are used to set the drawing grid to low, medium, or high resolution. At the

    you can place joints at 0.5 meter and 0.25 meter intervals, respectively.

    At first glance, the <topic-popup name="hlp_go_back">Go back button</topic-popup> and the
    <topic-popup name="hlp_undo">Undo button</topic-popup> might appear to be performing the same function. In practice,
    the two functions are closely related, but there are important distinctions between the two:
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use Undo to correct any mistakes you make while working on the <span class="i">current</span>
      <topic-link name="hlp_design_iteration">design iteration</topic-link>. Use Go Back to revert to a
      <span class="i">previous</span> design iteration. The Go Back function is normally used as part of the
      optimization process, rather than to correct drawing or editing errors.
    </li>
    <li>
      Undo is only available for the 100 most recent changes to your
      <topic-popup name="glos_structural_model">structural model</topic-popup>, but you can Go Back to

    </li>
    <li>
      Because Undo only applies to the current design iteration, the Undo function is disabled whenever you Go Back to a
      previous iteration. Undo is enabled again as soon as you make any new changes to the structural model.

  <h1>Slenderness ratio</h1>
  <div class="p">
    The slenderness ratio is a number that describes the &quot;thickness&quot; of a member. Members that are long in
    comparison to their <topic-popup name="hlp_crossxsection">cross-sections</topic-popup> have larger slenderness
    ratios than those that are shorter. Very slender members are more likely to buckle or to be damaged during handling.
    A <topic-link name="hlp_slenderness">slenderness check</topic-link> ensures that all members have slenderness ratios
    of no more than 300. Any overly slender member causes the bridge to fail.

  <h1>Slope</h1>
  <div class="p">
    The slope of a roadway or embankment is a measure of its steepness, expressed as a ratio of vertical distance to
    horizontal distance. For example, a river bank with a slope of 2:1 rises 2 meters for every 1 meter of horizontal
    distance.

<ng-template topic-name="glos_snap_points">
  <h1>Snap points</h1>
  <div class="p">
    A snap point is the intersection of two grid lines on the
    <topic-popup name="glos_drawing_grid">drawing grid</topic-popup>. Joints can only be drawn at the snap points; thus,
    when you draw or move <topic-popup name="glos_joints">joints</topic-popup> in your
    <topic-popup name="glos_structural_model">structural model</topic-popup>, the mouse pointer automatically
    &quot;snaps&quot; to the nearest snap point. The grid lines are actually not visible, but their locations are
    indicated by marks on the vertical and horizontal rulers located on the left and bottom edges of the Drawing Board.

<ng-template topic-name="glos_structural_model">
  <h1>Structural model</h1>
  <div class="p">
    A structural model is a mathematical idealization of an actual structure. The model allows us to predict how the
    actual structure will behave when it is loaded. A structural model of a truss has the following idealized
    characteristics:
  </div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      It is composed of <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup>, interconnected at
      <topic-popup name="glos_joints">joints</topic-popup>.
    </li>
    <li>Each member is connected to exactly two joints, one at each end.</li>
    <li>
      The joints are assumed to act like hinges; that is, they hold the members together, but do not prevent the ends of
      the members from rotating with respect to each other.
    </li>
    <li>
      The members only carry axial force--either <topic-popup name="glos_compression">compression</topic-popup> or
      <topic-popup name="glos_tension">tension</topic-popup>. They do not bend.
    </li>
    <li>Loads can be applied to the structure only at the joints.</li>
    <li>Supports can be placed only at the joints.</li>
  </ol>

<ng-template topic-name="glos_substructure">
  <h1>Substructure</h1>
  <div class="p">
    The substructure is the foundation of a bridge. It consists of the

    support the bridge and transmit its weight to the earth below.

<ng-template topic-name="glos_supports">
  <h1>Supports</h1>
  <div class="p">
    A support is a joint at which a structure is attached to its foundation. A truss bridge can have two different types
    of supports: (1) pinned supports, which restrain both horizontal and vertical movement of the associated joint, and
    (2) roller supports, which restrain vertical movement but allow horizontal expansion of the structure.

  <h1>Symmetrical</h1>
  <div class="p">
    The term &quot;symmetrical&quot; can apply to both a structure and its loading. In a symmetrical structure, the
    left-hand and right-hand sides of the structure are exact mirror images of each other. In a symmetrical loading, the
    <topic-popup name="glos_loads">loads</topic-popup> applied on either side of the bridge centerline are identical.
