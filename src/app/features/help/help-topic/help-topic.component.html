    It's best to keep the bridge design window maximized while working on your design. Reducing the window size makes
    drawing and editing your
    <topic-popup name="glos_structural_model">structural model</topic-popup> more difficult.

  <h1>Drawing board</h1>
  <p>
    The <span class="b">drawing board</span> is the portion of the
    <topic-link name="hlp_bridge_design_window">bridge design window</topic-link> where you create a
    <topic-popup name="glos_structural_model">structural model</topic-popup> by drawing
    <topic-popup name="glos_joints">joints</topic-popup> and <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> with
    your mouse. Using the drawing board, you can also edit the structural model by
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>moving, adding, or deleting joints</li>
    <li>changing member properties</li>
    <li>adding and deleting members.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="btop">Notes and tips</h2>
  <p>
    Use the <topic-popup name="hlp_drawing_board_button">drawing board button</topic-popup> to return to the drawing
    board after a <topic-popup name="glos_load_test">load test</topic-popup>.

    The drawing board is covered by a <topic-popup name="glos_drawing_grid">drawing grid</topic-popup>. (You can't see
    it, but it's there.) When you draw joints to create your structural model, your mouse "snaps" to the grid line

    drawn at the snap points.
  </p>
  <p>
    The drawing grid can be set to low, medium, or high resolution. Use the
    <topic-link name="hlp_grid_resolution">grid resolution buttons</topic-link> to switch among the three. It's often
    easiest to create your structural model using the low-resolution grid, then switch to the medium- and
    high-resolution settings for editing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Horizontal and vertical <topic-link name="hlp_rulers">rulers</topic-link> are displayed on the left and bottom edges

    A <topic-link name="hlp_titleblock">title block</topic-link> is displayed in the lower right-hand corner of the

  <h1>AASHTO H25 truck loading</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="img/help/hs20.png"
      alt="AASHTO H25 Truck Loading"
    />
    The <topic-popup name="glos_aashto">AASHTO</topic-popup> H25 loading is a hypothetical cargo truck, similar to the
    one pictured here. The truck has two axles spaced approximately 4 meters apart. The truck has a total weight of 225
    kilonewtons (kN), with 44 <topic-popup name="glos_kn">kN</topic-popup> applied at the front axle and 181 kN at the
    rear.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the AASHTO truck loading is used to design a bridge, the axle weights are generally increased by a factor
    called the <topic-popup name="glos_dynamic_load_allowance">dynamic load allowance</topic-popup>, which accounts for
    the effects of the moving load.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a structural engineer designs an actual bridge, he or she must ensure that <span class="i">all</span>
    <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> in the structure can safely carry the
    <topic-popup name="glos_forces">forces</topic-popup> generated when one AASHTO truck loading is applied to
    <span class="i">every traffic lane</span> on the bridge <topic-popup name="glos_deck">deck</topic-popup>. The truck
    loading can be positioned anywhere along the length of the bridge.
  </p>
  <p>
    As indicated in the <topic-link name="hlp_design_specifications">design specifications</topic-link>, the
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> allows you to design a bridge for either of two highway loading
    conditions:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Two lanes of highway traffic, represented by one H25 truck in each lane.</li>
    <li>A single 480 kN "permit loading," centered laterally on the roadway.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    In the first load case, with two traffic lanes, each of the two main trusses must carry the weight of one lane. Thus
    the loading used in the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> consists of one H25 truck, with a total weight
    of 225 kN.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the second case, with a single truck centered on the roadway, each of the two main trusses must carry one-half of
    the total truck weight. Thus the Permit Loading used in the
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> consists of 240 kN, with 120 kN applied at each axle location.
  </p>
  <p>In both cases, the dynamic load allowance is 1.33.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
      Move the <span class="b">animation speed slider</span> to change the speed of theh truck. These vary from 0.5 to

      deck. Otherwise a <span class="c14b">flat gray</span> is used.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Erosion</span> controls whether the terrain color is adjusted to depict soil erosion on steep
      slopes. Note that some computers may not properly draw eroded terrain due to bugs in graphics card drivers. If the
      terrain is strangely colored or disappears when <span class="b">erosion</span> is checked, just keep this control
      in the unchecked state.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Exaggeration</span> controls whether member deflections are exaggerated to make them more visible.
      When unchecked, the animation is realistic. When checked, changes in the shape of the truss under load are
      multiplied by 20 in order to make them more visible.
    </li>
    <li><span class="b">Truck</span> controls whether the cartoon of the truck loading is shown or hidden.</li>

  <p>
    Use the <topic-link name="hlp_animation_view_controls">animation view controls</topic-link> to walk under, over and
    through the bridge site.
  </p>
  <p>
    The animation controls palette is normally displayed whenever you
    <topic-link name="hlp_run_load_test">load test your design</topic-link>. The palette is automatically hidden when
    you return to the <topic-link name="hlp_drawing_board">drawing board.</topic-link> If you manually close the
    controls, you can make it visible again with the
    <topic-link name="hlp_view_animation_controls">view animation controls</topic-link> menu item.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you initiate the <topic-popup name="glos_load_test">load test</topic-popup>, the play button is automatically
    depressed.
  </p>
  <p>When you pause, you must use the play button to restart.</p>
  <p>
    The smoothness of the animation depends on the speed of your computer's processor and graphics system. If the motion
    looks too "jerky," try turning off some of the animation features. Turning off shadows is likely to have the
    greatest effect.

  <h1>Solid bar or hollow tube?</h1>
  <p>
    As you <topic-link name="hlp_optimize_member_selection">optimize the member properties</topic-link> in your design,
    one of the most important decisions you will make is the selection of a cross-section type -
    <span class="b">solid bar or hollow tube</span> - for each member in your
    <topic-popup name="glos_structural_model">structural model</topic-popup>. In making this decision, you should
    consider the effect of the different cross-sections on member strength in both
    <topic-popup name="glos_tension">tension</topic-popup> and
    <topic-popup name="glos_compression">compression</topic-popup>.
  </p>
  <h2>Compression members:</h2>
  <p>
    For a given material, hollow tubes are somewhat more expensive than solid bars, in dollars per kilogram. Compared
    with a solid bar <span class="i">of the same mass</span>, though, a hollow tube provides a much larger
    <topic-popup name="glos_moment_of_inertia">moment of inertia</topic-popup>. Thus a hollow tube resists
    <topic-popup name="glos_buckling">buckling</topic-popup> more efficiently than a solid bar. Its
    <topic-link name="hlp_compressive_strength">compressive strength</topic-link> is usually substantially greater. For
    compression <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup>, then, the increased compressive strength of a
    tube often outweighs the increased cost per kilogram.
  </p>
  <p class="btop brgt bbot blft">
    It is usually most economical to use hollow tubes for members that carry load primarily in compression.
  </p>
  <h2>Tension members:</h2>
  <p>
    For a given material, solid bars are somewhat less expensive than hollow tubes, in dollars per kilogram. However,
    <topic-link name="hlp_tensile_strength">tensile strength</topic-link> depends only on the
    <topic-popup name="hlp_crossxsection">cross-sectional area</topic-popup> of the member, not the moment of inertia. A
    solid bar and a hollow tube of the same mass also have the same cross-sectional area. Therefore, both have the same
    tensile strength. Since the solid bar costs less, and the hollow tube offers no strength advantage in tension, solid
    bars are usually the better choice for tension members.

  <h1>Compressive strength</h1>
  <p>
    The <span class="b">compressive strength</span> of a member is the internal force that causes it to become

    <topic-popup name="glos_compression">compression</topic-popup>. If the actual

<ng-template topic-name="hlp_cost">
  <h1>Cost of the design</h1>
  <p>
    The <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> automatically calculates the cost of your bridge design as you
    create it. This cost is continuously updated and displayed on the
    <topic-link name="hlp_toolbars">status toolbar</topic-link>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cost calculated by <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span><span class="i"> does not</span> accurately
    represent the total cost of an actual bridge project. Rather, it is intended to give a general appreciation for
    competing factors that influence the cost of a typical engineering project: a learning tool.
  </p>
  <p>
    The total cost of your bridge design consists of two major components -
    <topic-popup name="glos_site_cost">site cost </topic-popup> and truss cost. The site cost, in turn, is the sum of
    three components:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>excavation cost</li>
    <li><topic-popup name="glos_deck">deck</topic-popup> cost</li>
    <li>support cost</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The truss cost also includes three components:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>material cost</li>
    <li>connection cost</li>
    <li>product cost</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    All of these cost components are described below. The specific numerical cost factors for each are listed in the
    <topic-link name="hlp_design_specifications">design specifications</topic-link>.
  </p>
  <h2>Site Cost</h2>
  <p>
    The <span class="i">site cost</span> consists of all costs associated with your selection of the
    <topic-link name="hlp_select_project">site configuration</topic-link> - the deck height,
    <topic-popup name="glos_span">span</topic-popup> length, and support configuration of your bridge.
  </p>
  <p><span class="i">Excavation Cost</span></p>
  <p>
    When you select the deck height, you determine the amount of soil that must be excavated to achieve the correct
    highway elevation. The lower the deck, the more excavation is required. As in real-world construction, excavation is
    priced by the cubic yard or cubic meter. The
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> determines the required volume of soil excavation based on the selected
    deck elevation.
  </p>
  <p><span class="i">Deck Cost</span></p>
  <p>
    Your selection of the deck height also determines the overall span length of the bridge. A higher deck results in a
    longer span, which increases both the truss cost and the cost of the reinforced
    <topic-popup name="glos_concrete">concrete</topic-popup> deck.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span>, you can also select the material that the deck is made of -
    either medium-strength or high-strength concrete. Medium-strength concrete costs less than high-strength concrete,
    but its lower strength requires the deck to be thicker. This thicker deck weighs more than a thinner high-strength
    concrete deck and thus will increase the loading on the truss. Increased loading will cause the truss cost to
    increase. The result: a cheaper deck tends to require a more expensive truss and vice versa.
  </p>
  <p>In either case, the cost of the deck is specified as a lump-sum cost for each 4-meter deck panel.</p>
  <p><span class="i">Support Cost</span></p>
  <p>
    When you select the type of <topic-popup name="glos_abutment">abutments</topic-popup>,
    <topic-popup name="glos_pier">piers</topic-popup>, and cable
    <topic-popup name="glos_anchorages">anchorages</topic-popup> used in your bridge, the
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> determines the costs associated with constructing these supports. Each
    support configuration has its own unique cost. For a given type of
    <topic-popup name="glos_abutment">abutment</topic-popup> (standard or arch), the cost tends to increase with span
    length, because longer spans weigh more than shorter spans and thus transmit greater
    <topic-popup name="glos_loads">loads</topic-popup> to the supports. In general,
    <topic-popup name="glos_standard_abutments">standard abutments</topic-popup> cost less than
    <topic-popup name="glos_arch_abutments">arch abutments</topic-popup> for a given span length. The costs of arch
    abutments and piers also vary significantly with height. Higher abutments and piers use more material than shorter
    ones, so they cost more. Cable anchorages have a single lump-sum cost.
  </p>
  <h2>Truss Cost</h2>
  <p>
    The <span class="i">truss cost</span> consists of all costs associated with the structural steel
    <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> and
    <topic-popup name="glos_connections">connections</topic-popup> that make up the two main trusses - the principal
    load-carrying elements of the bridge.
  </p>
  <p><span class="i">Material cost</span></p>
  <p>
    Structural steel is normally priced by weight (or mass); e.g., dollars per pound or dollars per kilogram. Thus the
    cost of a structure depends, in part, on the total weight of material used to build it. The
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> calculates the material cost by
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      determining the total mass of the three available <topic-link name="hlp_materials">materials</topic-link> - carbon
      steel, high-strength steel, and quenched and tempered steel--in your
      <topic-popup name="glos_structural_model">structural model</topic-popup>
    </li>
    <li>multiplying the mass of each material type by the corresponding unit cost, in dollars per kilogram</li>
    <li>adding these together to get the total material cost.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    As noted in the <topic-link name="hlp_design_specifications">design specifications</topic-link>, each of the three
    different types of steel has a different unit cost. Carbon steel is least expensive; quenched and tempered steel is
    most expensive. For a given material, hollow tubes are more expensive (per kilogram) than solid bars.
  </p>
  <p><span class="i">Connection cost</span></p>
  <p>
    In real structures, the cost of fabricating and building the connections that join the members together can be very
    significant. Thus the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> includes a cost per joint as part of the total
    cost of the structure. Because the actual three-dimensional bridge has two main trusses, the number of connections
    used as the basis for this calculation is double the number of
    <topic-popup name="glos_joints">joints</topic-popup> in your two-dimensional structural model.
  </p>
  <p><span class="i">Product cost</span></p>
  <p>
    In structural design and construction, the most economical design is often <span class="i">not</span> the one that
    simply minimizes the material cost. Often the total cost of the structure can be reduced by standardizing materials
    and member sizes. If all the members in a structure are different materials and sizes, then the cost of ordering,
    fabricating, and constructing those members will be relatively high. If many members are the same, fabrication and
    construction costs will be relatively lower. For this reason, the
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> includes a cost per product as part of the total cost of the truss. A
    <span class="i">product</span> is defined as any unique combination of material, cross-section, and
    <topic-popup name="glos_member_size">member size</topic-popup> in your structural model.
  </p>
  <h2>Cost Calculations</h2>
  <p>
    To see the <span class="i">cost factors</span> (cost per kilogram, cost per joint, cost per product, and site cost)
    and the actual cost calculations for your current design, click the
    <topic-popup name="hlp_report_cost">report cost calculations button</topic-popup>. The
    <topic-link name="hlp_setup_wizard">site design wizard</topic-link> also displays detailed calculations for each
    component of the site cost.
  </p>
  <h2>Minimizing Total Cost</h2>
  <p>
    As you attempt to minimize the total cost of your bridge design, you will find that you can
    <span class="i">never</span> minimize the site cost, material cost, connection cost, and product cost
    simultaneously. Minimizing the total cost is always a compromise among these four competing factors.
  </p>
  <p>
    To minimize the <span class="i">site cost</span>, you would simply select the site configuration that costs the
    least. But the least expensive site configuration requires a simply supported truss spanning a full 44 meters. This
    configuration will require a relatively heavy truss - one with a high
    <span class="i">material cost.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    To minimize the <span class="i">material cost,</span> you must make each member as light as it can possibly be
    without failing. For most truss configurations, achieving this condition requires the use of
    <span class="i">both</span> solid bars and hollow tubes in a wide variety of different sizes. Minimizing the
    material cost requires you to use a lot of different products and, as a result, your
    <span class="i">product cost</span> will be quite high.
  </p>
  <p>
    To minimize the <span class="i">connection cost</span>, you must use the smallest possible number of joints. But if
    you minimize the number of joints, you will inevitably have a few <span class="i">very long</span> members in your
    structural model. If a long member is subjected to compressive loading, it will require a very large member size to
    keep it from failing. (As a member gets longer, its
    <topic-link name="hlp_compressive_strength">compressive strength</topic-link> decreases significantly.) Thus
    minimizing the connection cost usually results in a high <span class="i">material cost</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To minimize the <span class="i">product cost</span>, you would need to use a <span class="i">single</span> material,
    cross-section, and size for every member in your structural model. But your single member size would have to be
    large enough to ensure that the most heavily loaded member in the structure does not fail. As a result, many of the
    other members would be much stronger - and therefore much heavier - than they really need to be, and your
    <span class="i">material cost</span> would be extremely high.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clearly there are tradeoffs among site cost, material cost, connection cost, and product cost. Minimizing one
    <span class="i">always</span> increases one or more of the others. Your task as the designer is to find the best
    compromise.

        <li>
          If the elevation of the bridge <topic-popup name="glos_deck">deck</topic-popup> is below 24 meters, excavation

    The <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> ensures that your design satisfies all of the design specifications

  <p class="btop">
    At this point in the design process, you have optimized your design for one particular site configuration and load
    case--one particular combination of <topic-popup name="glos_deck">deck</topic-popup> height,
    <topic-popup name="glos_span">span</topic-popup> length, support configuration, deck material, and truck loading.
    But you won't know if your design is truly optimal until you have considered other site configurations and load
    cases as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> allows for 98 possible site configurations, consisting of various
    combinations of deck elevation, support type, and support height; and four possible load cases, consisting of
    various combinations of deck material (i.e., deck weight) and truck loading. The
    <topic-link name="hlp_cost">total cost</topic-link> of the bridge equals the
    <topic-popup name="glos_site_cost">site cost</topic-popup> plus the truss cost. Each site configuration supports the
    bridge in a different way, and thus each one has a different site cost. Each load case has a different effect on the
    steel truss, and thus each one is likely to result in a different truss cost.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though the site cost makes up a substantial portion of the total cost of the bridge, picking the configuration
    with the lowest site cost will not necessarily result in the lowest total cost. In general, site configurations that
    have a low site cost tend to have a relatively high truss cost and vice versa.
  </p>
  <p>
    A site configuration with a high deck elevation will generally have a relatively low site cost, because a higher
    deck requires little or no excavation. But a configuration with a high deck elevation also has a greater span
    length. A longer span requires a larger, heavier truss, which results in a higher truss cost.
  </p>
  <p>
    Arch <topic-popup name="glos_abutment">abutments</topic-popup> cost more than
    <topic-popup name="glos_standard_abutments">standard abutments</topic-popup>, and tall
    <topic-popup name="glos_arch_abutments">arch abutments</topic-popup> cost more than short ones. Thus site
    configurations that use arches tend to have higher site cost. But because of the V-shape of the river valley, arch
    abutments also reduce the span length (for a given deck height)--the taller the
    <topic-popup name="glos_abutment">abutment</topic-popup>, the shorter the span. Arch abutments also provide more
    lateral restraint than standard abutments. Both of these factors tend to cause the truss cost to be less for arches.
  </p>
  <p>
    Building a <topic-popup name="glos_pier">pier</topic-popup> in the middle of a river can be quite expensive. Thus
    configurations with <topic-popup name="glos_pier">piers</topic-popup> have significantly higher site costs than
    those without piers. But the pier also divides one long span into two short ones, and two short trusses are usually
    much less expensive than a single long one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cable <topic-popup name="glos_anchorages">anchorages</topic-popup> are also expensive, but they provide for
    additional support (e.g., the cable supports of a cable-stayed bridge) and thus can reduce the truss cost
    significantly.
  </p>
  <p>
    The choice of deck material affects both the site cost and the
    <topic-popup name="glos_loads">loads</topic-popup> applied during the
    <topic-link name="hlp_run_load_test">Load Test</topic-link>. Medium-strength
    <topic-popup name="glos_concrete">concrete</topic-popup> is less expensive than high-strength concrete but results
    in a thicker deck, which is heavier. High-strength concrete is more expensive but results in a thinner deck, which
    is lighter. Thus the less expensive deck material tends to result in a higher truss cost, while the more expensive
    deck material results in a lower truss cost.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your choice of truck loading has no effect on the site cost but will have a significant effect on the truss cost.
  </p>
  <p>
    Engineering design always involves <span class="i">tradeoffs</span>, and the tradeoff between the cost of a
    structure and the cost of its supporting <topic-popup name="glos_substructure">substructure</topic-popup> is a
    critically important aspect of most real-world bridge designs.
  </p>
  <p>
    So which site configuration and load case will result in the lowest total cost? The only way you can answer this
    question is by trial and error, combined with careful logical reasoning.
  </p>
  <h2>To find the optimum substructure configuration:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Click the <topic-popup name="hlp_new_design">New Design button</topic-popup>. When the
      <topic-link name="hlp_setup_wizard">Design Project Setup Wizard</topic-link> is displayed, select one of the site
      configurations or load cases you haven't tried yet. In making this choice, it is best to change only one variable
      at a time, so you can draw valid conclusions about the effect of the change. For example, suppose your first
      design was a single span with standard abutments and a deck height of 24 meters For your second design, you might
      try an arch, but leave the deck height at 24 meters. Then the cost difference between the two trials can be
      directly attributed to the different support type. If you change the support type <span class="i">and</span> the
      deck height simultaneously, you won't know how each of these factors affects the cost.
    </li>
    <li>
      Repeat the previous eight steps of the design process for the new site configuration or load case. Decide on a
      truss configuration, draw <topic-popup name="glos_joints">joints</topic-popup>, draw
      <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup>,
      <topic-popup name="glos_load_test">load test</topic-popup> the design, strengthen any
      <topic-popup name="glos_unsafe">unsafe</topic-popup> members, optimize the
      <topic-popup name="glos_member_properties">member properties</topic-popup>, optimize the shape of the truss, and
      optimize the truss configuration.
    </li>
    <li>
      Now compare the results of the two trials. Draw a logical conclusion about the one variable you changed on the
      second trial. For a particular deck height, did standard abutments or arch abutments result in a lower cost? How
      large was the difference between the two? If it was very large, you might be able to draw a general conclusion
      about the two support types. If the two results were close, you'll probably need to do some more trials.
    </li>
    <li>
      Try another new site configuration or load case. Again, change only one characteristic. If your second trial was a
      4-meter high arch, you might use a 12 meter or 16 meter height for this next trial. Again, repeat the entire
      design process to optimize your truss for this new site configuration. And again, compare these results with the
      previous trials and use the comparison as the basis for logical conclusions and new exploration.
    </li>
    <li>
      As you conduct more trials, you will be able to eliminate progressively more uneconomical site configurations and
      load cases. When you've eliminated all but one, you have the optimum.

      You will be presented with a requirement to design a steel
      <topic-link name="hlp_truss_bridges">truss bridge</topic-link> to carry a two-lane highway across a river.
    </li>
    <li>
      You may choose from a wide variety of different site configurations for your bridge. Each will cause your bridge
      to carry <topic-popup name="glos_loads">loads</topic-popup> in a different way, and each has a different
      <topic-popup name="glos_site_cost">site cost</topic-popup>.
    </li>
    <li>You will develop a design for your bridge by drawing a picture of it on your computer screen.</li>
    <li>
      Once your first design attempt is complete, the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> will test your
      bridge, to see if it is strong enough to carry the specified highway loads. This test includes a full-color
      animation showing a truck crossing your bridge. If your design is strong enough, the truck will be able to cross
      it successfully; if not, the structure will collapse.
    </li>
    <li>
      If your bridge collapses, you can strengthen it by changing the properties of the structural components that make
      up the bridge, or by changing the configuration of the bridge itself.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once your bridge can successfully carry the highway loading without collapsing, you can continue to refine your
      design, with the objective of minimizing its cost while still ensuring that it is strong enough to carry the
      specified loads.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> gives you complete flexibility to create designs using any shape or
    configuration you want. Creating the design is fast and easy, so you can experiment with many different alternative
    configurations as you work toward the best possible solution. The process you will use is quite similar to the
    process used by practicing civil engineers as they design real structures. Indeed, the
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> itself is quite similar to the computer-aided design (CAD) software
    used by practicing engineers, and it will help you in the same way that CAD software helps them--by taking care of
    the heavy-duty mathematical calculations, so that you can concentrate on the creative part of the design process.

  <p>Good luck!</p>

<ng-template topic-name="hlp_load_combinations">
  <h1>Load combinations</h1>
  <p>
    Structural engineers use <span class="b">load combinations</span> to account for the fact that structures often
    experience several different types of <topic-popup name="glos_loads">loads</topic-popup> at the same time. For
    example, a bridge must simultaneously carry its own weight, plus the weight of the traffic and pedestrians crossing
    it. But the bridge <span class="i">might</span> also have to carry the loads caused by high winds, snow, ice, or
    even an earthquake. It is highly unlikely that all of these extreme loads could occur at exactly the same time. For
    this reason, most structural design codes specify a number of different load combinations, each of which corresponds
    to a particular extreme event--a really heavy truck loading, or a really strong earthquake, for example. For each
    load combination, the extreme loading is combined with average levels of other loads that might be present at the
    same time the extreme event occurs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The 1994 <topic-popup name="glos_aashto">AASHTO</topic-popup> Bridge Design Specification requires bridge engineers
    to check eleven different load combinations for every bridge they design. The
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> uses only one of these eleven. It is:
  </p>
  <p class="in1">
    Total Load = 1.25 <span class="bi">Ws</span> + 1.5 <span class="bi">Ww</span> + 1.75 <span class="bi">T</span> (1+

<ng-template topic-name="hlp_local_contest">
  <h1>Local contest code</h1>
  <p>
    The Bridge Design Contest (BDC) includes support for two different types of local bridge design contests. In either
    case, a contest code is issued to the local contest organizer by the national BDC Coordinator. The first type, which
    uses a <span class="b">4-character Local Contest Code</span>, is best when the national BDC is in progress. Any
    bridge submitted to the local contest simultaneously competes in the national contest.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <span class="b">6-character Local Contest Code</span> is restricted to a single site configuration and load case.
    The designated site configuration and load case are embedded in the Local Contest Code. For this reason, the
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> allows the user to input a six-character Local Contest Code at the
    start of each new design. Local Contest Code entry is included as Step 2 in the
    <topic-link name="hlp_setup_wizard">Design Project Setup Wizard</topic-link>.The advantage of a 6-character contest
    is that students quickly produce competitive bridges for the single site. A disadvantage occurs if the national BDC
    is in progress: Bridges designed for the local contest are unlikely to be competitive nationally due to the site
    restriction.
  </p>
  <h2 class="in1">To enter a Local Contest Code:</h2>

    </li>
    <li>If you are using a 6-character Local Contest Code, enter it in the text box.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="btop">Notes and tips</h2>
  <p>
    The first three characters of a 6-character Local Contest Code uniquely identify the local contest (e.g., NHS for
    Northampton High School). The next two characters are a two-digit number representing the site configuration (i.e.,
    the <topic-popup name="glos_deck">deck</topic-popup> elevation and supports). The final character is a letter (A, B,
    C, or D) designating the Load Case. The load case consists of one of the two truck available loadings combined with
    one of the two available <topic-popup name="glos_concrete">concrete</topic-popup> deck thicknesses.

  <h1>Materials</h1>
  <p>
    The <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> allows you to use three different
    <span class="b">materials</span> in your design:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Carbon steel. This is the most common grade of structural steel, composed primarily of iron and about 0.26%
      carbon.
    </li>
    <li>
      High-Strength Low-Alloy steel. This increasingly popular structural steel is similar to carbon steel but
      significantly stronger. The higher strength is attained from small amounts of manganese, columbium, vanadium, and
      other alloying elements added during the manufacturing process.
    </li>
    <li>
      Quenched and Tempered Low-Alloy Steel. This very high-strength steel is similar to high-strength low-alloy steel,
      but its strength is further increased through a special heat-treating process.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="btop">Notes and tips</h2>
  <p>
    Which material is the best choice for a given structural design? The answer depends largely on the relative
    importance of cost and strength (yield stress) in the design. Carbon steel is the least expensive of the three
    alternatives, but it also has the lowest strength. High-strength low-alloy steel is somewhat more expensive but
    about 40% stronger than carbon steel. Quenched and tempered low-alloy steel is both the strongest and most expensive
    of the three. All three materials have approximately the same
    <topic-link name="hlp_material_densities">density</topic-link> and
    <topic-popup name="glos_modulus_of_elasticity">modulus of elasticity</topic-popup>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The "best" material often varies from structure to structure, and a given design may use more than one material.
    You'll need to do some experimenting to determine which materials are best for your design.

    To determine the actual numerical values of <topic-popup name="glos_yield_stress">yield stress</topic-popup>,

<ng-template topic-name="hlp_member_list">
  <h1>Member list</h1>
  <p>
    The <span class="b">Member List</span> is a movable grid that is normally displayed on the right-hand side of the
    <topic-link name="hlp_bridge_design_window">Bridge Design Window.</topic-link> When in use, the Member List reduces
    space available for the <topic-link name="hlp_drawing_board">Drawing Board;</topic-link> however, it can be easily
    hidden in order to view or edit the <topic-popup name="glos_structural_model">structural model</topic-popup>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <span class="b">Member List</span> and Member Details occupy the same screen location. If Member Details are
    visible, you can change to the Member List by clicking its tab at the upper right corner.
  </p>
  <p>The Member List does the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lists all of the <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> in the current structural model.</li>
    <li>
      Lists the engineering properties (length, <topic-link name="hlp_materials">material,</topic-link>
      <topic-popup name="hlp_crossxsection">cross-section,</topic-popup>
      <topic-popup name="glos_member_size">member size</topic-popup>, and
      <topic-popup name="glos_slenderness">slenderness ratio</topic-popup>) of each member.
    </li>
    <li>
      Provides the most recent <topic-popup name="glos_load_test">load test</topic-popup> results for each member.
    </li>
    <li>Provides a convenient means of selecting one or more members.</li>
    <li>Provides a means of sorting members--by member number, by engineering properties, or by load test results.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="btop">Notes and tips</h2>
  <p>
    In the Member List, load test results are shown as a ratio of
    <topic-popup name="glos_member_force">member force</topic-popup> to strength, for both
    <topic-popup name="glos_compression">compression</topic-popup> and
    <topic-popup name="glos_tension">tension</topic-popup>. Thus, if the ratio is greater than 1, the member is
    <topic-popup name="glos_unsafe">unsafe</topic-popup>. (Members that are unsafe in tension are highlighted in
    <span class="c1b">blue</span>; those that are unsafe in compression are highlighted in
    <span class="c5b">red</span>.) If the ratio is less than 1, the member is
    <topic-popup name="glos_safe">safe</topic-popup>. If the ratio is <span class="i">much</span> less than 1, the
    member is much stronger than it really needs to be and therefore is probably uneconomical.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Member List can be hidden and restored with the
    <topic-link name="hlp_view_member_list">View Member List button</topic-link> <img src="img/help/memtable.png" />. It
    can also be closed with the the <img src="img/help/close.png" /> button at the upper right.

  <p>
    To hide the Member List entirely, click the
    <topic-popup name="hlp_view_member_list">View Member List button.</topic-popup> If the list is already hidden, click
    the same button to restore it.
  </p>
  <p>
    To select a member, click anywhere within the corresponding row of the Member List. A selected member is highlighted
    in <span class="c2b">light blue</span>, both in the Member List and on the Drawing Board.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can click and drag with the mouse button down to select a range of members. Alternately you can select a range
    by clicking on one member, holding the Shift key down, and clicking a second member. This selects both of the
    clicked members and all members between
  </p>
  <p>To select more than one member simultaneously, hold down the Ctrl key while clicking the Member List.</p>
  <p>
    To sort the Member List, click the heading of the column you want to sort by. For example, to sort members by
    <span class="i">length</span>, click the heading of the Length column. The first time you click a column heading,
    the list will be sorted in <span class="i">ascending</span> order; if you click the same button a second time, it
    will be sorted in <span class="i">descending</span> order.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Member List can be used to
    <topic-link name="hlp_optimize_member_selection">optimize the member properties</topic-link> in your structural
    model very efficiently. Immediately following a Load Test, sort the Member List by
    <span class="c5b">compression</span> load test results. (Click Compression Force/Strength column heading.) The list
    will be sorted from <span class="i">most safe</span> to <span class="i">least safe</span>. Any unsafe members will
    be at the bottom of the list (highlighted in <span class="c5b">red</span>), and any excessively strong (i.e.,
    uneconomical) members will be at the top. Now you can select a block of members that needs to be made larger or
    smaller (see the discussion of block selection above), then use the
    <topic-popup name="hlp_increase_member">Increase Member Size button</topic-popup> or the
    <topic-popup name="hlp_decrease_member">Decrease Member Size button</topic-popup> to make the appropriate change to

  <h1>What is <em>not</em> realistic About the Bridge Designer?</h1>
  <p>
    One of the <topic-link name="hlp_purposes">purposes</topic-link> of the
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> is to provide a <span class="i">realistic</span>, hands-on experience
    that will help you to understand how civil engineers design real structures. Many aspects of the software accurately
    reflect the structural design process; however, a number of significant compromises have been made to keep the
    program from getting too complex. <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> is intended as an
    <span class="i">introduction</span> to engineering design, with emphasis on the
    <span class="i">design process</span>, rather than the detailed technical aspects of structural design.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bottom line is that some aspects of the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> are realistic, and some are
    not. It is important that you understand the difference.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following aspects of the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> <span class="i">do not</span> accurately
    reflect the process that practicing civil engineers use to design real bridges:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In designing an actual bridge, engineers must developed detailed designs and cost estimates for the
      <topic-popup name="glos_abutment">abutments</topic-popup>, the <topic-popup name="glos_pier">piers</topic-popup>,
      the roadway, the <topic-popup name="glos_deck">deck</topic-popup>, and the complete three-dimensional structural
      system, including the main trusses, all <topic-popup name="glos_connections">connections</topic-popup>, the
      <topic-popup name="glos_concrete">concrete</topic-popup> deck, its supporting steel framing, and many secondary
      <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup>. Engineers would also need to consider the environmental
      impact of the bridge and the effects of water and ice in the river channel as an integral part of the design. In
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> you only design the main trusses and make some preliminary decisions
      about the configurations of the roadway and supports. The design is strictly two-dimensional and thus does not
      account for three-dimensional stability.
    </li>
    <li>
      In designing an actual bridge, engineers must consider the effects of <span class="i">fatigue</span>--the tendency
      of a structural material to fail prematurely as a result of the repetitive loading caused by vehicular traffic.
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> does not consider fatigue.
    </li>
    <li>
      In designing an actual bridge, engineers must consider many different types of loading, to include several
      different forms of vehicular <topic-popup name="glos_loads">loads</topic-popup>, self-weight, wind, snow,
      collision by vehicles and ships, and earthquakes. They must consider both the longitudinal and lateral position of
      the vehicular loads on the bridge deck. They must also consider numerous
      <topic-link name="hlp_load_combinations">load combinations</topic-link>--eleven in the 1994
      <topic-popup name="glos_aashto">AASHTO</topic-popup> Bridge Design Specification.
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> considers only two types of vehicular loading and the self-weight of
      the bridge. It considers only the longitudinal position of the vehicular loading, not the lateral position.
    </li>
    <li>
      In designing an actual bridge, engineers must consider limitations on
      <span class="i">deflections</span>--the amount of bending that occurs when a vehicle crosses the bridge.
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> calculates deflections and displays them during the
      <topic-popup name="glos_load_test">load test</topic-popup>, but does not use them as a design criterion.
    </li>
    <li>
      In designing an actual bridge, engineers must consider many additional member failure modes not considered by the
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> load test, the
      <topic-popup name="hlp_aashto_h20x44">AASHTO truck loading</topic-popup> represents two lanes of highway traffic,
      and this loading is moved across the bridge in one direction - from left to right. The AASHTO loading has a heavy
      rear axle and a lighter front axle. Because this loading is asymmetrical, an optimally designed bridge might be
      asymmetrical as well. However, the design of real bridges must consider the movement of the AASHTO loading in
      <span class="i">both</span> directions: left to right <span class="i">and</span> right to left. As a result,
      optimally designed real-world bridges are generally symmetrical.

      Though <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> attempts to accurately demonstrate the cost tradeoffs inherent
      in engineering design, the actual costs of the structural materials and components used in the software are not

    <li>
      In designing an actual bridge, engineers must consider <span class="i">esthetics</span>.

  <p class="btop">
    At this point in the design process, you have optimized the
    <topic-popup name="glos_member_properties">member properties</topic-popup> for one specific truss configuration. But
    there are probably other configurations that will result in more economical designs. Design is inherently an
    iterative process. To achieve a truly optimal design, you will need to experiment with many different
    configurations, and carefully observe how changes in the truss geometry affect the cost of your design.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before you try a totally new truss configuration, you should first optimize the
    <span class="i">shape</span> of your current
    <topic-popup name="glos_structural_model">structural model</topic-popup>. You can change the shape of the truss by
    <topic-link name="hlp_move_joint">moving one or more joints</topic-link>--by dragging them to a new location with
    your mouse or keyboard. This modification is very easy to do and can produce significant reductions in the cost of
    your design.
  </p>
  <h2>To optimize the shape of your current structural model:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Try changing the depth of your truss.
      <p class="in3">For example, suppose you started with the standard Pratt Through Truss for your current design:</p>
      <p class="in4">
        <img
          alt="To optimize the shape of your current structural model:"
          src="img/help/pratt.png"
        />
      </p>
      <p class="in3">You might try reducing its depth:</p>
      <p class="in4">
        <img
          alt="To optimize the shape of your current structural model:"
          src="img/help/pratt_lo.png"
        />
      </p>
      <p class="in3">And you might try increasing its depth:</p>
      <p class="in4">
        <img
          alt="To optimize the shape of your current structural model:"
          src="img/help/pratt_hi.png"
        />
      </p>
      <p class="in3">
        At first glance, reducing the depth of the truss might seem like the better alternative. Reducing the depth will
        make the <topic-popup name="glos_verticals">verticals</topic-popup> and
        <topic-popup name="glos_diagonals">diagonals</topic-popup> shorter and, since these
        <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> will require less material, their cost will decrease.
        However, reducing the depth of a truss also causes the
        <topic-popup name="glos_member_force">member force</topic-popup> in the top and bottom
        <topic-popup name="glos_chords">chords</topic-popup> to <span class="i">increase</span>. Thus you will probably
        need to increase the size (and cost) of the top and bottom chord members to ensure that the design still passes
        the <topic-popup name="glos_load_test">load test</topic-popup>.
      </p>
      <p class="in3">
        If you increase the depth of the truss, the opposite effects will occur. The verticals and diagonals will get
        longer and, thus, they will increase in cost. But the member
        <topic-popup name="glos_forces">forces</topic-popup> in the top and bottom chords will decrease, allowing you to
        use smaller, less expensive members for the chords.
      </p>
      <p class="in3">
        There is a trade-off between these two competing factors: (1) the member force in the top and bottom chords and
        (2) the length of the verticals and diagonals. Every truss has an optimum depth, which represents the best
        compromise between these two factors. The best way to find the optimum depth for your design is through trial
        and error.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Try changing the overall shape of your truss.
      <p class="in3">For example, suppose you started with the standard Pratt Through Truss for your current design:</p>
      <p class="in4">
        <img
          alt="To optimize the shape of your current structural model:"
          src="img/help/pratt.png"
        />
      </p>
      <p class="in3">
        Try moving the top-chord <topic-popup name="glos_joints">joints</topic-popup> to create a more rounded shape:
      </p>
      <p class="in4">
        <img
          alt="To optimize the shape of your current structural model:"
          src="img/help/pratt_tc.png"
        />
      </p>
      <p class="in3">
        Often this minor adjustment can reduce the cost of a design significantly. When a truss has this rounded shape,
        the member forces tend to be nearly equal in every member in the top chord. Thus, if you get the shape just
        right, you can use a single optimum
        <topic-popup name="glos_member_size">member size</topic-popup> for the entire top chord--resulting in a
        substantial reduction in <topic-link name="hlp_cost">product cost.</topic-link>
      </p>
      <p class="in3">
        Changing to a more rounded shape is also effective for the bottom chord of a
        <topic-popup name="hlp_deck_truss">deck truss</topic-popup>:
      </p>
      <p class="in4">
        <img

      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="btop">Notes and tips</h2>
  <p>
    Whenever you change the shape of your truss, you will need to repeat the previous three steps in the design process:
    (1) run the load test, (2) identify and strengthen all
    <topic-popup name="glos_unsafe">unsafe</topic-popup> members, and (3) optimize the member properties. Only then can
    you determine whether or not the change was effective in reducing the cost of your design.

  <p class="btop">
    Once your <topic-popup name="glos_structural_model">structural model</topic-popup> has no
    <topic-popup name="glos_unsafe">unsafe</topic-popup>&ngsp;<topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup>, your
    design is <span class="i">successful</span>. However, your design is not <span class="i">optimum</span> until you
    minimize its cost. The first step in optimizing your design is to minimize the cost of your
    <span class="i">current truss configuration</span> by optimizing the
    <topic-popup name="glos_member_properties">member properties</topic-popup>--
    <topic-link name="hlp_materials">material,</topic-link>
    <topic-popup name="hlp_crossxsection">cross-section,</topic-popup> and
    <topic-popup name="glos_member_size">member size</topic-popup>. At this stage in the design process, you should not
    change the shape or configuration of your current structural model.
  </p>
  <h2>To optimize the member properties:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Ensure that you understand how the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> calculates the
      <topic-link name="hlp_cost">cost of your design.</topic-link> In particular, understand the trade-off between
      <span class="i">material cost</span> and <span class="i">product cost</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Minimize the <span class="i">material cost</span>. There are several approaches you might use to minimize material
      cost; the following procedure is recommended for inexperienced designers:
    </li>
    <li>Start by using the lowest cost (but weakest) available material - carbon steel - for all members.</li>
    <li>
      Select an appropriate <topic-popup name="hlp_crossxsection">cross-section</topic-popup> for each member. It is
      usually best to use solid bars for <topic-popup name="glos_tension">tension</topic-popup> members and hollow tubes
      for <topic-popup name="glos_compression">compression</topic-popup> members. For more information, see
      <topic-link name="hlp_bars_or_tubes">Solid Bar or Hollow Tube?</topic-link>
    </li>
    <li>
      Now use a systematic trial and error procedure to determine the smallest possible member size for every member in
      the structural model. Starting with a <span class="i">successful</span> design, decrease the size of every member
      to the next smaller available size. (See
      <topic-link name="hlp_change_member_properties">Change the Properties of a Member</topic-link> for more
      information.) Then run the <topic-popup name="glos_load_test">load test</topic-popup> again. If any member fails,
      its size is too small; change it back to its previous (larger) size. For each member that is
      <topic-popup name="glos_safe">safe</topic-popup>, decrease its size again, and run the load test. Keep reducing
      its size and running the load test until the member fails, then increase its size by one. If you use this process
      systematically for every member in the structural model, you will ensure that every member is as small (and
      inexpensive) as it can possibly be without failing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally, go back and check if using either of the other two materials--high-strength steel or quenched and
      tempered steel--will reduce the overall cost of the design. Both of these steels have significantly higher
      <topic-popup name="glos_yield_stress">yield stress</topic-popup> than carbon steel, so using them will allow you
      to reduce the size of members without reducing their strength. But both high-strength steel and quenched and
      tempered steel are more expensive (in dollars per kilogram) than carbon steel. You will need to use trial and
      error to determine if the benefit of increased strength is sufficient to offset greater cost of the high-strength
      steels. It is permissible to use two or three different materials in the same design.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once you have adjusted the materials, cross-sections, and member sizes to minimize the material cost of your
      design, be sure to run the load test once more to ensure that all members are safe.
    </li>
    <li>
      Optimize, based on <span class="i">product cost</span>. When you minimized the
      <span class="i">material cost</span> (above), you probably introduced a large number of different products into
      your design. Thus, even though your material cost is low, your <span class="i">product cost</span> is probably
      quite high, and your total cost is almost certainly not optimum. Use the following procedure to find the best
      balance between these two competing cost factors:
    </li>
    <li>
      Check the <topic-popup name="hlp_report_cost">Cost Calculations Report</topic-popup> to see how many products are
      currently included in your design. In particular, identify any products that are used for only a few members in
      your structural model.
    </li>
    <li>
      Change the properties of these particular members to match the next larger (or next stronger) available product in
      your current design. For example, suppose your design includes two 40 mm solid carbon steel bars and four 60 mm
      solid carbon steel bars. Change the two 40 mm bars to 60 mm bars. This modification will increase the material
      cost somewhat, but will reduce the number of products by one. This modification will probably
      <span class="i">not</span> reduce the safety of the structure, since you are making the two 40 mm members
      <span class="i">stronger</span>. If the reduction in product cost exceeds the increase in material cost, the
      change is a good one. If not, reject the change by clicking the
      <topic-popup name="hlp_undo">Undo button</topic-popup>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Continue this trial-and-error process of selectively increasing member sizes (or using stronger materials) to
      reduce the total number of products in the design. Generally, you will find that reducing the number of products
      creates substantial cost savings at first; however, as the degree of standardization increases, the cost savings
      get progressively less. Ultimately, too much standardization will cause the total cost of the design to rise. The
      design that minimizes total cost is the optimum.
    </li>
    <li>
      Before moving on to the next step in the design process, be sure to run the load test one more time,
      <span class="i">even if all of your modifications involved making members larger</span>. Increasing the size of a
      member makes that member both stronger and heavier. When member weights increase, the total weight of the truss
      increases. As a result of this increase in load, member <topic-popup name="glos_forces">forces</topic-popup> will
      also increase, and some members which were previously safe might become unsafe.
    </li>
  </ol>

    The <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> was developed by Brigadier General Stephen Ressler. The 2nd edition

  <h1>What is realistic about the bridge designer?</h1>
  <p>
    One of the <topic-link name="hlp_purposes">purposes</topic-link> of the
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> is to provide a <span class="i">realistic</span>, hands-on experience
    that will help you to understand how civil engineers design real structures. Many aspects of the software accurately
    reflect the structural design process; however, a number of significant compromises have been made to keep the
    program from getting too complex. <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> is intended as an
    <span class="i">introduction</span> to engineering design, with emphasis on the
    <span class="i">design process</span>, rather than the detailed technical aspects of structural design.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bottom line is that some aspects of the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> are realistic, and some are
    not. It is important that you understand the difference.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following aspects of the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> reflect, with reasonable accuracy, the
    nature of engineering design and the process that practicing civil engineers use to design real bridges:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Design is an open-ended process. Real-world design problems always have many possible solutions.
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> demonstrates this aspect of the design process by allowing you much
      freedom in developing the configuration of your bridge.
    </li>
    <li>
      Though design is open-ended, the process is always constrained by real-world conditions and restrictions.
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> demonstrates this aspect of the design process by limiting your
      design to specific <topic-popup name="glos_span">span</topic-popup> lengths and support configurations that
      conform to the conditions of the project site; by limiting your choices of available materials and member types;
      and by imposing the requirement to minimize cost.
    </li>
    <li>
      Design is inherently an iterative process. Because engineers usually work with incomplete information, they must
      often make assumptions, then subsequently check and revise those assumptions as the design process progresses.
      Developing a high-quality solution always requires the engineer to consider many different design alternatives,
      and ultimately select the best one.
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> clearly demonstrates this aspect of the design process. It is
      impossible to achieve a truly optimal bridge design without considering many different alternative truss
      configurations, materials, cross-sections, and member sizes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Design always involves trade-offs. It is usually not possible to find a single design solution that best satisfies
      all design criteria. Making improvements in one area often causes unexpected problems somewhere else. You will
      experience many of these same trade-offs when you use
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span>. For example, as you attempt to optimize your design, you will
      discover that reducing the <span class="i">depth</span> of a truss causes the cost of the
      <topic-popup name="glos_verticals">verticals</topic-popup> and
      <topic-popup name="glos_diagonals">diagonals</topic-popup> to <span class="i">decrease</span> (because they get
      shorter); but it also causes the cost of the top and bottom
      <topic-popup name="glos_chords">chords</topic-popup> to <span class="i">increase</span> (because their
      <topic-popup name="glos_member_force">member force</topic-popup> increases, and a larger member sizes are needed
      to preserve structural <topic-popup name="glos_safe">safety</topic-popup>). As in real-world structural design,
      you will need to find the optimum balance between the two competing criteria.
    </li>
    <li>
      Structural engineering design is regulated through the use of <span class="i">codes</span>. Codes ensure that
      engineering is practiced in a consistent, <topic-popup name="glos_safe">safe</topic-popup> manner throughout the
      country, region, or municipality. There are separate, industry-standard codes governing the design of steel,
      <topic-popup name="glos_concrete">concrete</topic-popup>, and wood structures. There are regional and local
      building codes that specify design <topic-popup name="glos_loads">loads</topic-popup>, fire protection standards,
      and many other requirements for designing buildings. Design of highway bridges in the U.S. is governed by the
      <topic-popup name="glos_aashto">AASHTO</topic-popup> Bridge Design Specification. In
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span>, the <topic-popup name="glos_load_test">load test</topic-popup> uses
      a standard (but slightly modified) AASHTO truck loading, and the compressive and tensile strengths of
      <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> are computed exactly as specified in the AASHTO
      Specification.
    </li>
    <li>
      Structures are generally designed such that they can safely carry one or more code-specified loadings. Minimizing
      cost is also often an important objective--but <span class="i">never</span> as important as structural safety.
      Cost reductions can never be made if those reductions compromise structural safety. The formulation of
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> is based on this same relationship between safety and cost. In
      <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> your design objective is to minimize cost, but a design is
      <span class="i">never</span> valid if it fails the load test.
    </li>
    <li>
      Structural design is often characterized by trade-offs between material cost, fabrication cost, and construction
      cost. When a structure is designed to minimize material cost, the design will often include many different member
      types and sizes. But a variety of member sizes makes it harder (and therefore more expensive) to
      <topic-popup name="glos_cut">cut</topic-popup> and fit the members (fabrication) and to actually assemble them on
      a job site (construction). Structural designers usually attempt to achieve a degree of
      <span class="i">standardization</span> in their selection of structural elements, even if that means
      over-designing some of them. The resulting increase in material cost is usually offset by savings in fabrication
      and construction costs. The <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> cost calculation simulates this trade-off
      with reasonable authenticity.
    </li>
    <li>
      In modern structural engineering practice,
      <topic-popup name="glos_structural_analysis">structural analysis</topic-popup> is generally performed using a
      computer -based method called <span class="i">matrix structural analysis</span>--more specifically the
      <span class="i">Direct Stiffness Method</span>. <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> uses this same method
      to compute member <topic-popup name="glos_forces">forces</topic-popup> during the load test.
    </li>
  </ul>

    That's the good news! But it is also important for you to recognize the bad news--

  <h2>Site Configuration</h2>
  <p>The site configuration consists of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Elevation of the <topic-popup name="glos_deck">deck</topic-popup> above the high water level</li>
    <li>
      Choice of standard <topic-popup name="glos_abutment">abutments</topic-popup> (simple supports) or

    activate the <topic-link name="hlp_drawing_board">Drawing Board</topic-link>.
  </p>
  <h2 class="btop">Notes and tips</h2>
  <p>
    Once the program is running, the only way to change the site configuration or load case is to start a new design.
    Clicking the <topic-popup name="hlp_new_design">New design button</topic-popup> will display the Design Project
    Setup Wizard.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are 98 possible site configurations, consisting of various combinations of deck elevation, support type, and
    support height. There are four possible load cases, consisting of combinations of the two available deck materials
    and two available truck loadings. Overall, then,
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> offers 392 possible design projects. Each project represents a
    different type of support or loading, and each one has a different cost--but all 392 are consistent with the
    <topic-link name="hlp_design_specifications">design specifications.</topic-link>
  </p>
  <p>
    The <topic-link name="hlp_cost">total cost</topic-link> of the bridge equals the site cost plus the truss cost. Each
    site configuration has a different cost, and the site cost makes up a substantial portion of the total cost of the
    bridge. But picking the configuration with the lowest site cost will not necessarily result in the lowest total
    cost. In general, site configurations that have a low site cost tend to have a relatively high truss cost and vice
    versa.
  </p>
  <p>
    A site configuration with a high deck elevation will generally have a relatively low site cost, because a higher
    deck requires little or no excavation. But a configuration with a high deck elevation also has a greater
    <topic-popup name="glos_span">span</topic-popup> length. A longer span requires a larger, heavier truss, which
    results in a higher truss cost.
  </p>
  <p>
    Arch abutments cost more than <topic-popup name="glos_standard_abutments">standard abutments</topic-popup>, and tall
    arch abutments cost more than short ones. Thus site configurations that use arches tend to have higher site cost.
    But because of the V-shape of the river valley, arch abutments also reduce the span length (for a given deck
    height)--the taller the <topic-popup name="glos_abutment">abutment</topic-popup>, the shorter the span. Arch
    abutments also provide more lateral restraint than standard abutments. Both of these factors tend to cause the truss
    cost to be less for arches.
  </p>
  <p>
    Building a pier in the middle of a river can be quite expensive. Thus configurations with
    <topic-popup name="glos_pier">piers</topic-popup> have significantly higher site costs than those without piers. But
    the pier also divides one long span into two short ones, and two short trusses are usually much less expensive than
    a single long one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cable anchorages are also expensive, but they provide for additional support (e.g., the cable supports of a
    cable-stayed bridge) and thus can reduce the truss cost significantly.
  </p>
  <p>
    The choice of deck material affects both the site cost and the loads applied during the
    <topic-link name="hlp_run_load_test">Load Test</topic-link>. Medium-strength concrete is less expensive than
    high-strength concrete but results in a thicker deck, which is heavier. High-strength concrete is more expensive but
    results in a thinner deck, which is lighter. Thus the less expensive deck material tends to result in a higher truss
    cost, while the more expensive deck material results in a lower truss cost.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your choice of truck loading has no effect on the site cost but will have a significant effect on the truss cost.
  </p>
  <p>
    Engineering design always involves <span class="i">tradeoffs</span>, and the tradeoff between the cost of a
    structure and the cost of its supporting <topic-popup name="glos_substructure">substructure</topic-popup> is a
    critically important aspect of most real-world bridge designs.
  </p>
  <p>
    So which site configuration and load case will result in the lowest total cost? For now, don't worry about it. Just
    take your best guess and move on to the <topic-link name="hlp_truss_configuration">next step</topic-link> in the
    design process. We'll try to
    <topic-link name="hlp_find_opt_substructure">find the optimum site configuration</topic-link> later in the process.

  <h1>Slenderness check</h1>
  <p>
    Very slender <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> are difficult to handle on a construction site.
    They tend to be inadvertently bent or buckled during fabrication. The <span class="b">slenderness check</span> is an
    evaluation to reduce the likelihood that this sort of accidental damage will occur.
  </p>
  <p>
    The slenderness check performed by the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> is based on the American
    Institute of Steel Construction design code. A member passes the slenderness check if its
    <span class="b">slenderness ratio</span>, <span class="bi">L</span> / <span class="bi">r</span>, meets the following
    condition:
  </p>
  <p class="in1"><span class="bi">L</span> / <span class="bi">r</span> &lt; <span class="b">300</span></p>
  <p>where</p>
  <p class="in1"><span class="bi">L</span> is the length of the member</p>

  <p class="in1">
    <span class="bi">I</span> is the <topic-popup name="glos_moment_of_inertia">moment of inertia</topic-popup> of the
    member

  <p class="in1">
    <span class="bi">A</span> is the <topic-popup name="hlp_crossxsection">cross-sectional area</topic-popup> of the
    member
  </p>
  <p>If a member fails the Slenderness Check, it is considered to be <span class="i">unserviceable</span>.</p>
  <h2 class="btop">Notes and tips</h2>
  <p>
    In the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span>, the slenderness check is performed automatically as you draw a
    new member or change the cross-section properties of an existing member. If a member fails the slenderness check
    (i.e., if <span class="bi">L</span> / <span class="bi">r</span> is greater than 300), then that member is
    highlighted in <span class="c6b">magenta</span>. If one or more members fail the slenderness check, then the
    <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> will not perform the Load Test.
  </p>
  <p>
    To fix a member that fails the slenderness check, decrease its length or increase its
    <topic-popup name="glos_member_size">member size</topic-popup>. For a given member size, hollow tubes have lower
    <span class="bi">L</span> / <span class="bi">r</span> than solid bars; thus, a solid bar that fails the slenderness
    check might also be fixed by changing it to a hollow tube.
  </p>
  <p>
    To see the maximum length that a member of a given
    <topic-popup name="hlp_crossxsection">cross-section</topic-popup> and member size can be without failing the
    slenderness check, click the Report Member Properties button. The maximum length is indicated by a vertical line
    that is colored <span class="c6b">magenta</span>.

    <li>
      Use a stronger <topic-link name="hlp_materials">material.</topic-link> If the unsafe member is carbon steel, try

      load test again to see if the increased strength of the new material is sufficient.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>

    <topic-link name="hlp_change_member_properties">change the properties of a member.</topic-link>
  </p>
  <h2 class="btop">Notes and tips</h2>
  <p>
    Of the two alternative methods, the better solution is the one that produces the required increase in strength with
    less increase in cost. Generally, increasing member size is the more effective method, because there are far more
    available member sizes than there are materials.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a member is unsafe in compression, using a stronger material may produce little or no increase in strength. For
    relatively slender members, the
    <topic-link name="hlp_compressive_strength">compressive strength</topic-link> is not dependent on the
    <topic-popup name="glos_yield_stress">yield stress</topic-popup> of the material.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you change the properties of an unsafe member (for example, by making it larger), the
    <span class="c5b">red</span> or <span class="c1b">blue</span> highlighting will disappear. This does not necessarily
    mean that the member is safe. To determine the true status of a member that has been modified, you must run the load
    test again.

  <h1>Structural stability</h1>
  <p>
    A truss is <span class="b">stable</span> if all of its <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> are
    interconnected as a rigid framework. Stability is usually achieved by ensuring that the truss is composed of
    interconnected triangles. For example, the simple truss below is composed of 6
    <topic-popup name="glos_joints">joints</topic-popup> and 9 members, which together form four interconnected
    triangles ( <span class="c5">ABF</span>, <span class="c5">BCF</span>, <span class="c5">CEF</span>, and
    <span class="c5">CDE</span>).
  </p>
  <p class="in1">
    <img
      src="img/help/stab1.png"
      alt="Structural Stability"
    />
  </p>
  <p>If member <span class="c5">CF</span> is removed, however, the truss becomes unstable.</p>
  <p class="in1">
    <img
      src="img/help/stab2.png"
      alt="Structural Stability"
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    Without its diagonal member, the center panel of the truss now consists of a rectangle (
    <span class="c5">BCEF</span>) formed by four members, rather than two triangles ( <span class="c5">BCF</span> and
    <span class="c5">CEF</span>). This configuration is unstable because there is nothing to prevent the rectangle
    <span class="c5">BCEF</span> from distorting into a parallelogram, as shown below:
  </p>
  <p class="in1">
    <img
      src="img/help/stab3.png"
      alt="Structural Stability"
    />
  </p>
  <p>The triangular arrangement of members ensures that the truss structure is a rigid framework.</p>
  <p>
    To fix an unstable truss, look for any "panel" of the
    <topic-popup name="glos_structural_model">structural model</topic-popup> that is not a triangle, then add one or
    more members to transform that panel into a series of interconnected triangular shapes.
  </p>
  <h2 class="btop">Notes and tips</h2>
  <p>
    If you are having trouble creating a stable structural model, try
    <topic-link name="hlp_load_a_template">loading a template</topic-link> and using it as a guide for drawing joints
    and members.
  </p>
  <p>
    If an actual structure is unstable, it will collapse. If a structural model is unstable, the
    <topic-popup name="glos_structural_analysis">structural analysis</topic-popup> is mathematically impossible. (The
    computer will attempt to divide by zero.)
  </p>
  <p>
    If your structural model is unstable, the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> will detect and attempt to
    fix the instability during the <topic-link name="hlp_run_load_test">Load Test</topic-link>. If the attempted fix is
    unsuccessful, <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> will display a warning message, and you will have to
    return to the <topic-link name="hlp_drawing_board">Drawing Board</topic-link> and modify your structural model to
    eliminate the instability.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though most trusses are composed of interconnected triangles, it is possible to have one or more non-triangular
    panels in a stable truss. This is particularly true for complex truss configurations and for trusses with
    <topic-popup name="glos_arch_supports">arch supports</topic-popup>. In such cases, you probably won't be able to
    tell whether or not the truss is stable just by looking at it. The ultimate test for stability is to run the Load
    Test. If the Load Test runs without displaying the "your structural model is unstable" warning, then your truss is
    stable.

  <h1>The engineering design process</h1>
  <p>
    The <span class="b">engineering design process</span> is the application of math, science, and technology to create
    a system, component, or process that meets a human need.
  </p>
  <p>
    In practice, engineering design is really just a specialized form of <span class="b">problem solving</span>.
    Consider the simple 7-step problem-solving process below:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><span class="b">Identify the problem</span></li>
    <li><span class="b">Define the problem</span></li>
    <li><span class="b">Develop alternative solutions</span></li>

    <li><span class="b">Select the best alternative</span></li>
    <li><span class="b">Implement the solution</span></li>
    <li><span class="b">Evaluate the results</span></li>
  </ol>
  <p class="btop">When civil engineers design a bridge, they typically use this same process:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Identify the problem.</span> A <topic-popup name="glos_client">client</topic-popup> hires a team
      of engineers to design a highway bridge that will cross a river.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Define the problem.</span> The engineers investigate the proposed site and work with the client to
      determine exactly what the functional requirements of the bridge will be. Where will the bridge be located? How
      many lanes of traffic are required? What are the characteristics of the river--width, depth, current velocity? Is
      the river used by ships? If so, how wide a navigable channel and how much overhead clearance do the vessels need?
      Who owns the land on either side of the river? What sort of soil and rock are located there? The engineers also
      determine if there are any aesthetic requirements for the structure and, perhaps most importantly, they find out
      how much money the client is willing to pay for the new bridge--the project budget.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Develop alternative solutions.</span> The engineers develop several alternative
      <span class="i">concept designs</span> for the new bridge--perhaps a truss, an arch, and a suspension bridge.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Analyze and compare alternative solutions.</span> The engineers analyze each design alternative to
      determine its strengths and weaknesses, with respect to the project requirements and constraints identified in
      Step 2 above. They also consider the environmental impact and constructibility of each proposed option.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Select the best alternative.</span> After carefully analyzing all of the alternatives, the
      engineers select the one that best satisfies the project requirements. They present this selection as a
      recommendation to the client, who makes the final decision.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Implement the solution.</span> Once the client has approved the concept design, the team completes
      the final design, prepares plans and specifications, and hands them over to a construction contractor to build.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="b">Evaluate the results.</span> At the end of the project, the engineers evaluate the completed
      structure. They identify aspects of the project that went well and aspects that could be improved. Ultimately
      these observations help to improve the quality of future projects.

    A truss is an arrangement of structural <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> that are connected
    together to form a rigid framework. In most trusses, members are arranged in interconnected triangles, as shown in
    the example below:
  </p>
  <p class="in1">
    <img
      alt="What is a Truss?"
      src="img/help/dwarren.png"
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    As a result of this configuration, truss members carry load primarily in axial
    <topic-popup name="glos_tension">tension</topic-popup> and
    <topic-popup name="glos_compression">compression</topic-popup>. Because they are very rigid and they carry load
    efficiently, trusses are able to <topic-popup name="glos_span">span</topic-popup> large distances with a minimum of
    material.
  </p>
  <h2>Truss Bridges</h2>
  <p>
    Trusses have been used extensively in bridges since the early 19th Century. Early truss bridges were made of wood.
    The classic American covered bridges are all trusses, though the wooden truss members are covered by walls and a
    roof, for protection from the elements. Later truss bridges were made of cast iron and wrought iron. Most modern
    trusses are made of structural steel. Truss bridges can be found in many different
    <topic-link name="hlp_standard_truss">configurations,</topic-link> but virtually all have the same basic
    <topic-link name="hlp_component_parts">component parts.</topic-link>
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many other types of bridges. These include beam bridges, arches, suspension bridges, and cable-stayed
    bridges.

    Design is inherently an iterative process. To achieve a truly optimal design, you will probably need to try many
    different truss configurations. As you might guess, however, there are
    <span class="i">millions</span> of possible configurations, and you probably won't have time to try them all! How
    can you find the optimum, without modeling and testing every possible truss configuration? One approach is to
    consider alternative configurations in a very systematic way. Select a configuration, optimize its
    <topic-popup name="glos_member_properties">member properties</topic-popup>, and carefully observe how changes in the
    configuration affected the cost of your design. Keep track of which changes produce reductions in cost and which do
    not. Then use these observations to guide the selection of your next alternative configuration.
  </p>
  <h2>To find the optimum truss configuration:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Try a different <topic-popup name="glos_deck">deck</topic-popup> location. If your first design was a
      <topic-popup name="hlp_deck_truss">deck truss</topic-popup>, try the corresponding
      <topic-popup name="hlp_through_truss">through truss</topic-popup> configuration, and vice versa.
    </li>
    <li>
      Try a different <topic-link name="hlp_standard_truss">standard truss configuration.</topic-link> For example, if
      your first design was a Pratt truss, try a Howe or Warren configuration.
    </li>
    <li>
      Try reducing the length of the <topic-popup name="glos_compression">compression</topic-popup>
      <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> in the truss. The
      <topic-link name="hlp_compressive_strength">compressive strength</topic-link> of a member is a function of its
      length. As a member gets longer, its compressive strength decreases substantially--it has much less resistance to
      <topic-popup name="glos_buckling">buckling</topic-popup>. For this reason, the cost of a truss design can
      sometimes be reduced by shortening one or more compression members.
      <p class="in2">For example, let's start with a standard Warren Through Truss:</p>
      <p class="in3">
        <img
          src="img/help/warren.png"
          alt="To find the optimum truss configuration:"
        />
      </p>
      <p class="in2">
        Because the top <topic-popup name="glos_chords">chords</topic-popup> of a simple-span truss bridge are always in
        compression, we might be able to reduce the cost of the Warren truss by subdividing its top chord members, like
        this:
      </p>
      <p class="in3">
        <img
          src="img/help/warren_c.png"
          alt="To find the optimum truss configuration:"
        />
      </p>
      <p class="in2">Now consider a standard Pratt Through Truss:</p>
      <p class="in3">
        <img
          src="img/help/pratt.png"
          alt="To find the optimum truss configuration:"
        />
      </p>
      <p class="in2">
        In this configuration, the top chords <span class="i">and</span> the
        <topic-popup name="glos_verticals">verticals</topic-popup> are normally in compression. Thus, we could subdivide
        <span class="i">both</span> the top chords and the verticals, like this:
      </p>
      <p class="in3">
        <img
          src="img/help/pratt_c1.png"
          alt="To find the optimum truss configuration:"
        />
      </p>
      <p class="in2">
        Note that, in both examples, the length of each compression member is reduced by half. This reduction in length
        will usually allow the designer to use a substantially smaller
        <topic-popup name="glos_member_size">member size</topic-popup> to achieve the required compressive strength.
      </p>
      <p class="in2">
        Note also that, when you subdivide a member, you will always need to add additional
        <topic-popup name="glos_joints">joints</topic-popup> and members to maintain the
        <topic-link name="hlp_structural_stability">stability</topic-link> of the truss. To be stable, a truss generally
        must be made up of a series of interconnected triangles.
      </p>
      <p class="in2">
        To subdivide a compression member in the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span>, you must:
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><topic-link name="hlp_delete_member">delete the compression member</topic-link> you want to subdivide,</li>
    <li>
      <topic-link name="hlp_draw_joint">add a new joint</topic-link> at or near the midpoint of the member you just
      deleted,
    </li>
    <li><topic-link name="hlp_draw_member">add two new members</topic-link> to replace the original member,</li>
    <li>add additional members to ensure <topic-link name="hlp_structural_stability">stability,</topic-link> and</li>
    <li>
      <topic-link name="hlp_optimize_member_selection">optimize the member properties</topic-link> of all new members.
      <p class="in2">
        Reducing the length of compression members may or may not reduce the total cost of your design, depending on
        whether the cost saving from using smaller member sizes is enough to offset the increased cost of the additional
        joints and members.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Try reducing the number of joints. The <topic-link name="hlp_cost">cost of your design</topic-link> includes a
      fixed cost per joint. Thus you may be able to reduce the total cost by reducing the number of joints in your
      <topic-popup name="glos_structural_model">structural model</topic-popup>.
      <p class="in2">For example, consider the standard Howe Deck Truss:</p>
      <p class="in3">
        <img
          src="img/help/dhowe.png"
          alt="To find the optimum truss configuration:"
        />
      </p>
      <p class="in2">
        This configuration can be improved by simply removing the joint at the midpoint of the bottom chord, like this:
      </p>
      <p class="in3">
        <img
          src="img/help/dhowe_b.png"
          alt="To find the optimum truss configuration:"
        />
      </p>
      <p class="in2">
        When you <topic-link name="hlp_delete_joint">delete this joint,</topic-link> all three attached members will be
        deleted as well. You will need to add a single new member to replace the two bottom chord members you deleted.
      </p>
      <p class="in2">
        This modification is often effective for <topic-popup name="glos_tension">tension</topic-popup> members (like
        the bottom chord members in the example above), because
        <topic-link name="hlp_tensile_strength">tensile strength</topic-link> is <span class="i">not</span> a function
        of length. However, removing a joint from the top chord of a truss, as shown below, is less likely to be
        effective.
      </p>
      <p class="in3">
        <img
          src="img/help/pratt_t2.png"
          alt="To find the optimum truss configuration:"
        />
      </p>
      <p class="in2">
        By deleting a top chord joint and replacing two chord members with one, you would double the length of a
        compression member, making it <span class="i">much</span> weaker. You would need to use a substantially larger
        member size to make this member strong enough to pass the
        <topic-popup name="glos_load_test">load test</topic-popup>. Thus any benefit from the reduced number of joints
        would probably be lost.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Try inventing your own truss configuration, or copy the configuration of an actual bridge. Here are some examples
      of actual bridge configurations you might consider:

  </p>
  <p>
    The <topic-link name="hlp_drawing_board">Drawing Board</topic-link> is covered by a grid. (You can't see it, but
    it's there.) When you draw or move <topic-popup name="glos_joints">joints</topic-popup>, your mouse "snaps" to the
    grid line intersections, which are called <topic-popup name="glos_snap_points">snap points</topic-popup>. Joints can
    only be drawn at the snap points.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Grid Resolution buttons are used to set the drawing grid to low, medium, or high resolution. At the
    low-resolution setting, you can place joints at 1.0 meter intervals. At the medium- and high-resolution settings,
    you can place joints at 0.5 meter and 0.25 meter intervals, respectively.

  <p>
    It is generally best to <span class="i">create</span> your

    When editing your structural model, you can use the keyboard arrows to
    <topic-link name="hlp_move_joint">move joints</topic-link> at 0.25 meter intervals--regardless of the current grid

  <h1>What is a design iteration?</h1>
  <p>
    Anytime you make one or more changes to your
    <topic-popup name="glos_structural_model">structural model</topic-popup>, then run the
    <topic-popup name="glos_load_test">load test</topic-popup>, you have performed one
    <span class="b">design iteration</span>. The <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span> saves all design
    iterations created during the current <topic-popup name="glos_session">session</topic-popup> and provides the
    capability for you to revert to previous iterations at any time during the session.
  </p>
  <h2 class="btop">Notes and tips</h2>
  <p>
    To revert to a previous design iteration, click the
    <topic-popup name="hlp_go_back">Go back button</topic-popup> or the
    <topic-popup name="hlp_go_to">Go To Iteration button.</topic-popup>
  </p>
  <p>
    The current design iteration number is always displayed on the
    <topic-link name="hlp_toolbars">Main Toolbar</topic-link>. The number is incremented at the
    <span class="i">start</span> of each new iteration--whenever you make the <span class="i">first</span> change to
    your structural model after a load test.
  </p>
  <p>
    Design iteration numbers are never duplicated, and the design iterations themselves are never overwritten, even when
    you revert to a previous iteration. For example, suppose you are working on design iteration 10
    <span class="i">,</span> then decide to go back to to iteration 6. The design iteration number displayed on the Main
    Toolbar will change from 10 to 6 accordingly. But as soon as you make <span class="i">any</span> change to the
    structural model, the design iteration number will update to 11, since you now have initiated a
    <span class="i">new</span> iteration. In this way, all of your previous iterations--6, 7, 8, 9, and 10--are
    preserved for future use.
  </p>
  <p>You can see how design iterations are related using the <span class="b">Tree View</span> tab.</p>
  <p>
    Reverting to a previous design iteration can be particularly useful when you are optimizing your design. The
    optimization process is never linear; it is always marked by dead ends and unexpected outcomes. Some of your
    attempts at optimization will be successful and others will not. After an unsuccessful attempt, you can simply
    revert to a previous successful design iteration and try again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Previous design iterations are only preserved until the end of the current session. When you start a new design or
    exit the <span class="bd-emph">Bridge Designer</span>, previous iterations are deleted. Thus the
    <topic-popup name="hlp_go_to">Design Iteration Browser</topic-popup> can <span class="i">only</span> display
    iterations created during the current session.

    the two functions are closely related, but there are important distinctions between the two:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use Undo to correct any mistakes you make while working on the <span class="i">current</span>
      <topic-link name="hlp_design_iteration">design iteration.</topic-link> Use Go Back to revert to a

    </li>
    <li>
      Undo is only available for the 100 most recent changes to your

<ng-template topic-name="glos_load_factors">
  <h1>Load factors</h1>
  <p>
    A load factor is a number (normally greater than 1) which is multiplied by a design load in order to represent an
    extreme loading experienced by a structure. For example, the load factor 1.75 is multiplied by the standard
    <topic-popup name="glos_aashto">AASHTO</topic-popup> H25 Truck Loading to represent an extremely heavy truck. In
    fact, it represents the heaviest truck that might reasonably be expected to cross the bridge in its lifetime.
  </p>
  <p>
    Different kinds of <topic-popup name="glos_loads">loads</topic-popup> have different load factors, because some
    loads are more unpredictable than others. For example, the weight of the bridge is more predictable than the weight
    of a heavy truck, so the load factor for bridge weight is much lower.

  <h1>Load test</h1>
  <p>
    In the Bridge Designer, the load test is a simulated test of how well your design would perform if it were built and

  <h1>Resistance factor</h1>
  <p>
    A resistance factor is a dimensionless number used in the calculation of tensile strength and compressive strength
    for structural <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup>. The resistance factor provides a margin of
    <topic-popup name="glos_safe">safety</topic-popup> for the design. It accounts for uncertainty in material strength,
    member dimensions, and construction quality. A resistance factor is always less than or equal to 1.

<ng-template topic-name="glos_safe">
  <h1>Safe</h1>
  <p>
    A member is safe when the internal <topic-popup name="glos_member_force">member force</topic-popup> is less than the
    strength of the member, in both <topic-popup name="glos_tension">tension</topic-popup> and
    <topic-popup name="glos_compression">compression</topic-popup>.
  </p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_session">
  <h1>Session</h1>
  <p>
    You initiate a new session anytime you start new design, load a sample design, or open an existing
    <topic-popup name="glos_bridge_design_file">bridge design file</topic-popup>. Within a given session, all of your
    design iterations are preserved. You can revert to a previous design iteration at any time during the session by
    clicking the Go back button.

<ng-template topic-name="glos_simple_supports">
  <p></p>
  <h1>Simple supports</h1>
  <p>
    Simple supports consist of a pin at one end of the <topic-popup name="glos_span">span</topic-popup> and a roller at
    the other end. The roller allows for lateral expansion and contraction of the bridge, due to
    <topic-popup name="glos_loads">loads</topic-popup> and temperature changes. In the Bridge Designer, standard
    <topic-popup name="glos_abutment">abutments</topic-popup> use simple supports.
  </p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_site_cost">
  <h1>Site cost</h1>
  <p>
    In the Bridge Designer, the site cost includes the cost of the
    <topic-popup name="glos_substructure">substructure</topic-popup> (the
    <topic-popup name="glos_abutment">abutments</topic-popup> and <topic-popup name="glos_pier">piers</topic-popup> that
    support the bridge) and the cost of the <topic-popup name="glos_concrete">concrete</topic-popup>
    <topic-popup name="glos_deck">deck</topic-popup>. The site cost must be added to the truss cost to determine the
    total project cost.
  </p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_slenderness">
  <h1>Slenderness ratio</h1>
  <p>
    The slenderness ratio is a number that describes the "thickness" of a member. Members that are long in comparison to
    their <topic-popup name="hlp_crossxsection">cross-sections</topic-popup> have larger slenderness ratios than those
    that are shorter. Very slender members are more likely to buckle or to be damaged during handling. A
    <topic-link name="hlp_slenderness">slenderness check</topic-link> ensures that all members have slenderness ratios
    of no more than 300. Any overly slender member causes the bridge to fail.
  </p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_slope">
  <h1>Slope</h1>
  <p>
    The slope of a roadway or embankment is a measure of its steepness, expressed as a ratio of vertical distance to
    horizontal distance. For example, a river bank with a slope of 2:1 rises 2 meters for every 1 meter of horizontal
    distance.
  </p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_snap_points">
  <h1>Snap points</h1>
  <p>
    A snap point is the intersection of two grid lines on the
    <topic-popup name="glos_drawing_grid">drawing grid</topic-popup>. Joints can only be drawn at the snap points; thus,
    when you draw or move <topic-popup name="glos_joints">joints</topic-popup> in your
    <topic-popup name="glos_structural_model">structural model</topic-popup>, the mouse pointer automatically "snaps" to
    the nearest snap point. The grid lines are actually not visible, but their locations are indicated by marks on the
    vertical and horizontal rulers located on the left and bottom edges of the Drawing Board.
  </p>

<ng-template topic-name="glos_span">
  <h1>Span</h1>
  <p>The span of a bridge is its length from support to support.</p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_standard_abutments">
  <h1>Standard abutments</h1>
  <p>
    In the Bridge Designer, standard abutments are
    <topic-popup name="glos_substructure">substructure</topic-popup> elements that use
    <topic-popup name="glos_simple_supports">simple supports</topic-popup> to hold up the bridge and transmit its weight
    to the soil below.
  </p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_structural_analysis">
  <h1>Structural analysis</h1>
  <p>
    A structural analysis is a mathematical analysis of a
    <topic-popup name="glos_structural_model">structural model</topic-popup>, to determine all of the

    <topic-popup name="glos_forces">forces</topic-popup> resulting from a given set of

</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_structural_model">
  <h1>Structural model</h1>
  <p>
    A structural model is a mathematical idealization of an actual structure. The model allows us to predict how the
    actual structure will behave when it is loaded. A structural model of a truss has the following idealized
    characteristics:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      It is composed of <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup>, interconnected at
      <topic-popup name="glos_joints">joints</topic-popup>.
    </li>
    <li>Each member is connected to exactly two joints, one at each end.</li>
    <li>
      The joints are assumed to act like hinges; that is, they hold the members together, but do not prevent the ends of
      the members from rotating with respect to each other.
    </li>
    <li>
      The members only carry axial force--either <topic-popup name="glos_compression">compression</topic-popup> or
      <topic-popup name="glos_tension">tension</topic-popup>. They do not bend.
    </li>
    <li>Loads can be applied to the structure only at the joints.</li>
    <li>Supports can be placed only at the joints.</li>
  </ol>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_substructure">
  <h1>Substructure</h1>
  <p>
    The substructure is the foundation of a bridge. It consists of the
    <topic-popup name="glos_abutment">abutments</topic-popup> and <topic-popup name="glos_pier">piers</topic-popup> that
    support the bridge and transmit its weight to the earth below.
  </p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_supports">
  <h1>Supports</h1>
  <p>
    A support is a joint at which a structure is attached to its foundation. A truss bridge can have two different types
    of supports: (1) pinned supports, which restrain both horizontal and vertical movement of the associated joint, and
    (2) roller supports, which restrain vertical movement but allow horizontal expansion of the structure.
  </p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_symmetrical">
  <h1>Symmetrical</h1>
  <p>
    The term "symmetrical" can apply to both a structure and its loading. In a symmetrical structure, the left-hand and
    right-hand sides of the structure are exact mirror imges of each other. In a symmetrical loading, the
    <topic-popup name="glos_loads">loads</topic-popup> applied on either side of the bridge centerline are identical.
  </p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_template">
  <h1>Template</h1>
  <p>
    In the Bridge Designer, a template is a diagram depicting a standard truss configuration. If you load a template, it
    is displayed on the Drawing Board in light grey dotted lines. The template will show you where to locate
    <topic-popup name="glos_joints">joints</topic-popup> and <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> to
    create a stable truss design.
  </p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_tension">
  <h1>Tension</h1>
  <p>
    Tension is an internal axial <topic-popup name="glos_member_force">member force</topic-popup> that tends to
    &lt;&lt;&lt;lengthen&gt;&gt;&gt; a member.
  </p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_through_truss">
  <h1>Through truss</h1>
  <p>
    A through truss is a truss with its <topic-popup name="glos_deck">deck</topic-popup> located at the bottom chord. On
    a through truss, vehicles truss pass between the two main trusses as they cross the bridge.
  </p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_unsafe">
  <h1>Unsafe</h1>
  <p>
    A member is unsafe when the internal <topic-popup name="glos_member_force">member force</topic-popup> exceeds the
    strength of the member. A member is unsafe in <topic-popup name="glos_tension">tension</topic-popup> if the maximum
    tension force exceeds the tensile strength. A member is unsafe in
    <topic-popup name="glos_compression">compression</topic-popup> if the maximum compression force exceeds the
    compressive strength.
  </p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_verticals">
  <h1>Verticals</h1>
  <p>
    Verticals are truss <topic-popup name="glos_members">members</topic-popup> that are oriented vertically. Usually
    they connect the top and bottom <topic-popup name="glos_chords">chords</topic-popup> together.
  </p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_wearing_surface">
  <h1>Wearing surface</h1>
  <p>
    A wearing surface is a layer of pavement material--normally
    <topic-popup name="glos_asphalt">asphalt</topic-popup> or
    <topic-popup name="glos_concrete">concrete</topic-popup>--placed on top of a bridge
    <topic-popup name="glos_deck">deck</topic-popup> to protect the deck from being damaged by automobile traffic.
  </p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_yield_stress">
  <h1>Yield stress</h1>
  <p>
    The yield stress is the strength of a metal. It is the force per unit area at which the metal fails by
    <topic-popup name="glos_yielding">yielding</topic-popup>.
  </p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template topic-name="glos_yielding">
  <h1>Yielding</h1>
  <p>
    Yielding is one possible failure mode for a member made of metal. When a metallic material fails by yielding, it
    undergoes very large deformations (i.e., it stretches) without being able to carry any additional load.
