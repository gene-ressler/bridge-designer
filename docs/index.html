    <h2>About Bridge Designer</h2>
    <div class="para">
      Bridge Designer, Cloud Edition is a free web application for learning about engineering design. The user solves
      the problem of designing and testing a highway bridge across a river. The test involves driving a standard truck
      load over the bridge to ensure it's strong enough. But that's not all! The <i>most successful</i> bridge is the
      one with lowest cost. The Bridge Designer continuously shows the cost of the current design, based on the amount
      of preparation required at the bridge site, the design's complexity, and the kind and amount of materials used,
