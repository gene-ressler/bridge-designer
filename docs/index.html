    <h2>About Bridge Designer</h2>
    <div class="para">
      Bridge Designer, Cloud Edition is a free web application for learning about engineering design. The user solves
      the problem of designing and testing a highway bridge across a river. The test involves driving a standard truck
      load over the bridge to ensure it's strong enough. But that's not all! The <i>most successful</i> bridge is the
      one with lowest cost. The Bridge Designer continuously shows the cost of the current design, based on the amount
      of preparation required at the bridge site, the design's complexity, and the kind and amount of materials used.
      Iterate to see how low you can get the cost of your bridge! Compete to see whose is best!

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Is anything new?</span> Yes! New fly-through test visualization, 3d printing support, and
        more. For details, see "What's new?" in the Help of Bridge Designer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">What's the catch?</span> None! Use Bridge Designer, Cloud Edition freely as much as you like
        for educational purposes only. The source is also freely available under the GNU public license, v3.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold"
          >Is the Cloud Edition related to earlier apps The Bridge Designer, Engineering Encounters Bridge Designer, and
          West Point Bridge Designer?</span
        >
        Yes! All the older versions were desktop applications for Windows and Mac. Many users have asked for a version
        to run on Chromebook and other platforms with only a web browser. We answered with the Cloud Edition. It's
        engineered to seem as similar as possible to the old versions so that teachers' experience and lesson plans
        won't need much changing.
