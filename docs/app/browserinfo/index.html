    <h1>About your browser...</h1>
    <div class="p">
      If you ended up here, your browser is missing features needed by Bridge Designer. Sorry about that. We do our best
      to make Bridge Designer work with most computing devices having a mouse or similar gadget plus a broad range of
      up-to-date browser software.
    </div>
    <h2>What should work</h2>
    <div class="p">
      <span class="b">Not phones.</span> Sorry. We don't support pure touch devices like most smart phones and pads with
      no mouse.
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      <span class="b">Browsers.</span> Up-to-date versions of these should be fine:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Based on recent Chromium:
          <ul>
            <li>Google Chrome</li>
            <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
            <li>Chromium, open source</li>
            <li>Opera</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Firefox</li>
      </ul>
      Other Chromium- and Firefox-based browsers may work fine. Unfortunately, we can't support Apple Safari.
    </div>
    <div class="p"><span class="b">Screen resolution.</span> At least 1200 by 800 pixels. More is better.</div>
    <div class="p">
      <span class="b">Mouse.</span> An accurate mouse-like pointing device. For example, a track pad or track ball
      should be fine.
    </div>
    <h2>How to fix problems</h2>
    <div>
      <span class="b">Switch browsers or upgrade.</span> If a startup warning complained about an unsupported browser or
      missing HTML or CSS features, try installing the current version of one of the supported browsers. If your device
      is unable, try the latest possible version of Google Chrome. That's the best chance of success.
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      <span class="b">Adjust settings or hardware as needed.</span> If a startup warning included screen resolution or
      mouse, you'll want to adjust or replace hardware. Pro tips:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Screen resolution is usually a choice. Check your operating system's display settings. You want one 
          that's at least 1200x800.
        </li>
        <li>
          For screen resolutions near the minimum, set the browser to full screen mode to use all possible pixels.
        </li>
        <li>Many devices support adding a mouse, often for just a few dollars. Check the web.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      <span class="b">Take your chances.</span> Bridge Designer might be okay with the current browser despite the
      warnings, though some features are likely to be disabled or work poorly. You'll be notified about disabled
      features. Give it a try by clicking Cancel in the warning dialog.
    </div>
    <h2>Help us out</h2>
    <div class="p">
      <span class="b">Report problems.</span> Report a bug at the
